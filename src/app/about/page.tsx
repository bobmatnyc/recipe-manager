              Joanie grew up in upstate New York, where she helped her dad run his
              children's clothing store — an early lesson in creativity, community,
              and persistence. After studying at Brandeis and the London School of
              Economics, she launched a fast-paced career as a bond trader in London
              and New York. But Joanie's path has always been full of twists, each one
              adding another layer of texture to her story.

              She's raised two wonderful sons, run a carpet wholesale business, worked
              as an energy auditor, and now serves as a volunteer firefighter in
              Hastings-on-Hudson — where she lives with her partner, Masa, in a home
              nestled in the hills overlooking the Hudson River. When she's not
              cooking or tending her garden, you'll find her paddleboarding on the
              river or sharing glimpses of her life at{" "}

              Cooking has been her lifelong rhythm. Joanie began experimenting in her
              London kitchen, later trained in culinary school, and spent time as a
              professional chef. Her food is deeply personal — inspired by what's
              growing, what's on hand, and who's at the table.

              </a>, was beloved by local
              restaurants for its famous tomatoes and vibrant produce. Today in
              Hastings, she and Masa cultivate an eclectic mix of tomatoes, ground
              cherries, eggplant, peppers, watermelon, squash, kale, collards, figs,
              cucumbers, and shiso — always enough to share.

              Joanie is known for her "nothing in the fridge" challenge — the art of
              transforming a handful of odds and ends into an extraordinary meal. Her
              cooking is jazz-like: instinctive, improvisational, and full of heart.
              Whether it's her fiery tom yum soup, ground lamb in delicata squash, or
              silky mapo tofu, Joanie's food celebrates what's real, seasonal, and
              joyful — from garden to table.
