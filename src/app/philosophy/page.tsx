              The Story Behind This Platform
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-base text-jk-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                <strong>Joanie</strong> doesn't cook from recipes. She cooks from her fridge.
                Every meal begins with the same question: <em>"What do I have that might go bad?"</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                This isn't about perfection or planning. It's about <strong>resourcefulness</strong> — seeing
                what you have as an opportunity, not a constraint. A wilting bunch of spinach becomes sautéed greens.
                Leftover chicken transforms into fried rice. Vegetable scraps simmer into rich stock.
              </p>
              <p>
                Joanie's approach comes from a lifetime of gardening, cooking, and caring about where food comes from
                and where it goes. She sees the connection between soil, plant, table, and compost. Nothing is wasted
                because everything has value.
              </p>
              <p>
                When she said, <em>"I'd like to see technology help with food waste,"</em> it wasn't a casual remark.
                It was a vision. This platform exists to embody that vision — to help you cook the way Joanie cooks,
                with flexibility, creativity, and zero waste.

                    The oldest ingredients get used first. It's that simple. Check your fridge regularly,
                    move older items to the front, and plan meals around what needs using up.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-base text-jk-charcoal/70 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>In practice:</strong> That head of lettuce from Tuesday comes before the one you
                    bought Friday. The carrots starting to soften get roasted tonight. The chicken from Monday's
                    dinner becomes Wednesday's fried rice.

                    From wilting lettuce to vegetable scraps, everything has a use if you know where to look.
                    Sauté aging greens. Save veggie peels for stock. Compost what truly can't be eaten.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-base text-jk-charcoal/70 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>In practice:</strong> Herb stems go into stock. Carrot tops become pesto.
                    Chicken bones simmer for broth. Overripe bananas get frozen for smoothies. The goal
                    isn't perfection — it's <em>progress</em>.

                  <p className="text-base text-jk-charcoal/70 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                    A "perfect" recipe that requires a shopping trip isn't better than an imperfect one made
                    with what you have. Substitutions aren't compromises — they're creativity.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-base text-jk-charcoal/70 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>In practice:</strong> No butter? Use olive oil. No lemon? Try vinegar.
                    Missing an ingredient? Ask what it's contributing (acid? fat? bulk?) and swap accordingly.
                    Cooking becomes a conversation with your pantry, not obedience to a recipe.

          <p className="text-base text-jk-charcoal/70 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            This circular thinking — understanding that food comes from somewhere and returns somewhere —
            creates respect for ingredients and urgency about not wasting them.

        </div>

        {/* Technology's Role */}
        <div className="bg-white rounded-2xl p-8 mb-12 border-2 border-jk-sage/20">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading text-jk-olive mb-4">
            🖥️ Why Technology Matters
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base text-jk-charcoal/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Most recipe platforms encourage <em>consumption</em>: browse beautiful photos, plan perfect meals,
            shop for specialty ingredients. That's the opposite of what Joanie does.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-jk-charcoal/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This platform is different. It asks: <strong>"What do you have?"</strong> instead of "What do you want?"
            It suggests substitutions instead of demanding precision. It celebrates resourcefulness instead of
            perfection.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-jk-charcoal/70 leading-relaxed">
            Technology should help you waste less, cook with confidence, and see your fridge as full of possibilities —
            not obligations. That's what Joanie meant. That's what we're building.
          </p>
