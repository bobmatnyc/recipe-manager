DISCOVERY TASK - Find recipes that were:
- Published during this specific week (${weekInfo.startDate} to ${weekInfo.endDate})
- Featured or highlighted during this week on recipe websites
- Trending or popular in this time period
- Include recipes with week/month publication metadata (e.g., 'Week of Sept 14', 'Mid-September ${weekInfo.year}')

PRIORITIZE recipes with exact publication dates, but INCLUDE relevant recipes from this timeframe even if the exact date is approximate or unclear.

TRUSTED RECIPE SOURCES (search these sites):
- AllRecipes.com
- Food Network (foodnetwork.com)
- Serious Eats (seriouseats.com)
- Bon AppÃ©tit (bonappetit.com)
- Epicurious (epicurious.com)

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Recipe blog posts with publication dates in this week
- New recipe releases from major food sites
- Seasonal/trending recipes highlighted during this period
- Weekly recipe roundups or features

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must have clear ingredient lists and cooking instructions
2. Direct URLs to recipe pages (NOT category/index pages)
3. Complete recipes (NOT recipe roundups or collections)
4. Prefer established recipe sources
5. Avoid duplicate recipes

For each recipe found, provide:
- Direct URL to the recipe page
- Recipe title
- Brief description or key ingredients
- Publication date if available (or note 'approximate' if unclear)
- Source website name

Return ONLY a JSON array in this EXACT format with NO markdown code blocks:
[
  {
    "title": "Recipe Title Here",
    "url": "https://example.com/full-recipe-url",
    "snippet": "Brief description of the recipe and what makes it special",
    "publishedDate": "YYYY-MM-DD or 'approximate'",
    "source": "Website Name"
  }
]

Return ONLY the JSON array. No markdown, no code blocks, no explanations.`;
