## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No recipes found**
```bash
# Ensure recipes are populated first
# Activity generation requires existing recipes
```

```bash
# Clean up and retry
pnpm seed:users:delete-all
pnpm seed:users:migrate
pnpm seed:users:generate
pnpm seed:users:insert
```

**Avatars not loading**
```bash
# Check files and permissions
ls public/avatars/synthetic/
chmod 644 public/avatars/synthetic/*.jpg
pnpm dev  # Restart dev server
```

### Getting Help

1. Check documentation: `scripts/seed-users/README.md`
2. Review troubleshooting section
3. Verify database schema: `src/lib/db/user-discovery-schema.ts`
4. Check status: `pnpm seed:users:status`
