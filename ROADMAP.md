## 📝 Notes for Development

### Philosophy Reminder

Before implementing anything, always ask:
1. **Does this help users waste less food?**
2. **Does this promote cooking with what you have?**
3. **Would Joanie approve?**
4. **Does this serve resourcefulness or consumption?**

If the answer is "no" to any - reconsider or modify the approach.

### Technical Principles

**Maintain:**
- Type safety and existing patterns
- Performance standards (queries <500ms)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Authentication system (Clerk)
- Database integrity

**Prioritize:**
- User experience over feature complexity
- Simplicity over sophistication
- Waste reduction impact over technical impressiveness
- Real user value over vanity metrics

### When In Doubt

- Choose the simpler implementation
- Focus on core waste-reduction value
- Keep Joanie's philosophy central
- Ask: "Would this help someone waste less food?"
