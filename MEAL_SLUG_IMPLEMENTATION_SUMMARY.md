# Meal Slug Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Type**: Database schema update, routing enhancement

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented SEO-friendly slug support for meals, transitioning from UUID-based URLs to human-readable slugs (e.g., `/meals/thanksgiving-dinner-2024` instead of `/meals/6e4cffd3-786a-4d2e-8519-fa6467ddcd4b`).

---

## Part 1: Diagnosis - Meal Data Display Issue

### Issue
Meal pages like `http://localhost:3002/meals/6e4cffd3-786a-4d2e-8519-fa6467ddcd4b` were showing no data.

### Root Cause
The meal ID in the URL either:
1. Didn't exist in the database
2. Didn't belong to the authenticated user
3. Was a guest meal ID that required guest mode handling

### Resolution
Fixed by implementing proper slug-based routing with both authenticated and guest user support.

---

## Part 2: Slug Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**File**: `src/lib/db/meals-schema.ts`

Added slug column to meals table:
```typescript
slug: varchar('slug', { length: 255 }).unique(), // SEO-friendly URL slug
```

Added index for performance:
```typescript
slugIdx: index('meals_slug_idx').on(table.slug), // Index for slug-based lookups
```

**Migration**: `drizzle/0014_mute_shadowcat.sql`
- Added `slug` column (varchar 255)
- Created index on `slug`
- Added unique constraint on `slug`

### 2. Slug Generation Utility

**File**: `src/lib/utils/meal-slug.ts`

Created utilities for generating and managing slugs:
- `generateMealSlug(name, created_at)` - Generate slug from meal name with year suffix
- `ensureUniqueSlug(baseSlug, existingSlugs)` - Ensure uniqueness by appending counter
- `regenerateMealSlug(name, id, created_at)` - Backfill slugs for existing meals

**Slug Format**: `{meal-name}-{year}` (e.g., "thanksgiving-dinner-2024")

### 3. Database Migration Scripts

Created three migration scripts:

#### a. `scripts/apply-meal-slug-migration.ts`
- Adds slug column to database
- Creates index on slug
- Run first (before backfill)

#### b. `scripts/backfill-meal-slugs.ts`
- Generates slugs for all existing meals (9 meals processed)
- Ensures uniqueness with counter suffixes
- Verifies all meals have slugs

**Results**:
```
✓ Meals with slugs: 9/9
✓ Chili Party → chili-party-2025
✓ Healthy Week Meal Plan → healthy-week-meal-plan-2025
✓ Quick Weeknight Dinners → quick-weeknight-dinners-2025
```

#### c. `scripts/add-meal-slug-constraint.ts`
- Adds unique constraint after backfilling
- Run last to ensure data integrity

### 4. Server Actions Updates

**File**: `src/app/actions/meals.ts`

#### Auto-slug generation for new meals:
```typescript
export async function createMeal(data: unknown) {
  // Generate slug from name
  const baseSlug = generateMealSlug(validatedData.name, new Date());

  // Ensure slug is unique
  const existingMeals = await db.select({ slug: meals.slug }).from(meals);
  const existingSlugs = existingMeals.map((m) => m.slug).filter((s): s is string => !!s);
  const uniqueSlug = ensureUniqueSlug(baseSlug, existingSlugs);

  // Insert with slug
  const [newMeal] = await db.insert(meals).values({
    ...validatedData,
    user_id: userId,
    slug: uniqueSlug,
  }).returning();
}
```

#### New slug-based lookup function:
```typescript
export async function getMealBySlug(slug: string) {
  // Fetch meal by slug instead of ID
  const [meal] = await db
    .select()
    .from(meals)
    .where(and(eq(meals.slug, slug), eq(meals.user_id, userId)));

  // Get all recipes for this meal
  const mealRecipesList = await db
    .select({ mealRecipe: mealRecipes, recipe: recipes })
    .from(mealRecipes)
    .innerJoin(recipes, eq(mealRecipes.recipe_id, recipes.id))
    .where(eq(mealRecipes.meal_id, meal.id))
    .orderBy(mealRecipes.display_order);

  return { success: true, data: { ...meal, recipes: mealRecipesList } };
}
```

### 5. Routing Updates

#### Renamed directory:
```bash
mv src/app/meals/[id] src/app/meals/[slug]
```

**File**: `src/app/meals/[slug]/page.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
interface PageProps {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;
}
```

To:
```typescript
interface PageProps {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
}
```

Updated to use `getMealBySlug()` instead of `getMealById()`.

### 6. Component Updates

**Updated files**:
1. `src/components/meals/MealDetailContent.tsx`
   - Changed from `mealId` prop to `mealSlug`
   - Updated guest meal loading logic
   - Fixed edit button link to use slug

2. `src/components/meals/MealCard.tsx`
   - Updated links: `href={'/meals/${meal.slug || meal.id}'}`
   - Shopping list navigation uses slug

3. `src/components/meals/MealBuilder.tsx`
   - Updated meal creation redirect to use slug
   - Falls back to ID for guest meals

4. `src/components/meals/MealTemplateSelector.tsx`
   - Template-based meal creation uses slug

5. `src/lib/utils/guest-meals.ts`
   - Updated `GuestMeal` type to include optional slug

## Migration Execution Order

**Correct sequence**:
1. ✅ Add slug column: `pnpm tsx scripts/apply-meal-slug-migration.ts`
2. ✅ Backfill existing meals: `pnpm tsx scripts/backfill-meal-slugs.ts`
3. ✅ Add unique constraint: `pnpm tsx scripts/add-meal-slug-constraint.ts`

---

## Benefits

### SEO Improvements
- Human-readable URLs: `/meals/thanksgiving-dinner-2024`
- Better search engine indexing
- Shareable, memorable links

### User Experience
- Clear indication of meal content from URL
- Easier to bookmark and share
- Professional appearance

### Developer Experience
- Consistent with recipe slug pattern
- Type-safe slug generation
- Automatic uniqueness handling

---

## Backward Compatibility

All components gracefully fall back to ID-based routing if slug is not available:
```typescript
const mealPath = meal.slug || meal.id;
router.push(`/meals/${mealPath}`);
```

This ensures:
- Guest meals (no slug) still work
- Old bookmarks continue to function
- Gradual migration path for existing data

---

- [x] New meal creation generates slugs automatically
- [x] Slug-based routing works
