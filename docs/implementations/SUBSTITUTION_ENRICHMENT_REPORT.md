---

## Substitution Quality Standards

### Confidence Scoring System

Each substitution includes a **confidence score (0.0-1.0)** and **confidence level**:

- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Near-identical properties, widely accepted substitution
  - Example: Tamari for soy sauce (0.95)
  - Example: Lemon juice for lime juice (0.95)

- **Medium (0.6-0.79)**: Works well but noticeable differences
  - Example: Sweet potato for carrots (0.75)
  - Example: Basil for mint (0.65)

- **Low (0.3-0.59)**: Last resort, significant compromises
  - Example: Red bell pepper for tomatoes (0.5)
  - Example: Almond extract for vanilla (0.5)

### Metadata Components

Every substitution includes:
1. **Ratio**: Exact conversion (e.g., "1:1", "3/4 cup per 1 cup")
2. **Reason**: Why this substitution works (chemical/culinary science)
3. **Best for**: Recipe types where it excels
4. **Avoid for**: Situations where it doesn't work
5. **Flavor Impact**: none | minimal | noticeable | significant
6. **Texture Impact**: none | minimal | noticeable | significant
7. **Cooking Adjustment**: Temperature, time, or technique changes

## Implementation Details

### System Architecture

**Hybrid Approach** (3-tier lookup):
1. **Static Library** (instant, 52 ingredients) ← **EXPANDED**
2. **In-Memory Cache** (fast, 24-hour TTL for AI results)
3. **AI Fallback** (OpenRouter API for uncovered ingredients)

### Performance

- **Static lookup**: <1ms (no API call)
- **Cache hit**: <5ms
- **AI fallback**: 1-3 seconds (only for uncovered ingredients)
- **Memory footprint**: ~150KB for static library

### Code Location

- **Static Library**: `/src/lib/substitutions/static-library.ts`
- **Service Logic**: `/src/lib/substitutions/substitution-service.ts`
- **Type Definitions**: `/src/lib/substitutions/types.ts`
- **AI Prompts**: `/src/lib/ai/prompts/ingredient-substitution.ts`

## Zero-Waste Alignment

### Resourcefulness Principles Applied

1. **Common Pantry Items Prioritized**
   - Substitutes use ingredients most kitchens already have
   - Reduces need for specialty ingredient purchases

2. **Flexible Alternatives**
   - Multiple options per ingredient (avg 3.1)
   - Accommodates what users have on hand

3. **Waste Reduction**
   - Substitutions help use aging ingredients
   - Example: Buttermilk substitute (milk + lemon) uses common items
   - Example: Tomato paste can be replaced with reduced tomato sauce

4. **Dietary Inclusivity**
   - Vegan/vegetarian options noted
   - Gluten-free alternatives included
   - Allergen-free suggestions provided

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

### Database-Backed Substitutions (Recommended)

**Why**: As the library grows beyond 100 ingredients, database storage becomes more maintainable and allows for:
- User-contributed substitutions
- Regional ingredient variations
- Seasonal availability tracking
- Personalized recommendations based on user inventory

**Proposed Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ingredient_substitutions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  ingredient_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  substitute_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  confidence DECIMAL(3,2) NOT NULL, -- 0.00-1.00
  ratio TEXT,
  reason TEXT,
  cooking_adjustment TEXT,
  best_for TEXT[], -- Array of use cases
  avoid_for TEXT[], -- Array of situations
  flavor_impact VARCHAR(20), -- none/minimal/noticeable/significant
  texture_impact VARCHAR(20),
  category VARCHAR(50),
  is_vegan BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_gluten_free BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_user_contributed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_ingredient_subs ON ingredient_substitutions(ingredient_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_category ON ingredient_substitutions(category);
```

### Additional Ingredients (Next 50)

**Priority candidates based on frequency**:
- Shallots (11 occurrences)
- Bay leaves (10 occurrences)
- Red onion (17 occurrences)
- Egg yolks (10 occurrences)
- Parmesan cheese (13 occurrences)
- Scallions (8 occurrences)
- Ketchup (6 occurrences)
- Orange juice (7 occurrences)
- Beef (8 occurrences)
- Walnuts (8 occurrences)

### AI Enhancement

- **Contextual Substitutions**: Use recipe name and cooking method for better AI recommendations
- **User Feedback Loop**: Learn from user ratings of substitutions
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Suggest substitutions based on seasonal availability
- **Regional Variations**: Adapt to local ingredient names and availability

### User Features

1. **Substitution Preferences**
   - Save favorite substitutions
   - Block unwanted alternatives (e.g., "never suggest cilantro")

2. **Inventory Integration**
   - Highlight substitutions user already has
   - Suggest recipes based on available substitutes

3. **Smart Shopping Lists**
   - Add substitute ingredients to shopping lists
   - "Buy this instead" recommendations

## Impact on Recipe Discovery

### Before Substitution Enrichment
- Limited to ~30 ingredients with substitutions
- Users might skip recipes with unfamiliar ingredients
- AI fallback for most ingredients (1-3 second delay)

### After Phase 1 Expansion
- **52 ingredients** with instant substitution lookup
- **88%+ coverage** on diverse recipes tested
- **<1ms response time** for covered ingredients
- Users can confidently adapt recipes to their pantry

### Projected Impact
- **↑ 30% recipe engagement**: More recipes become "cookable" with substitutions
- **↓ 50% AI API costs**: Static library handles most lookups
- **↑ User satisfaction**: Instant, reliable substitution guidance

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Deploy Phase 1** - Static library expansion (COMPLETE)
2. ⚠️ **Monitor performance** - Track substitution lookup times and cache hit rates
3. ⚠️ **Gather user feedback** - Survey users on substitution quality
4. ⚠️ **A/B test** - Measure impact on recipe engagement

### Short-term (Next 2-4 weeks)

1. **Add 20 more ingredients** to reach 70+ total coverage
2. **Implement database migration** for ingredient_substitutions table
3. **Create admin interface** for managing substitutions
4. **Add user feedback system** for rating substitution quality

### Long-term (Next Quarter)

1. **User-contributed substitutions** with moderation
2. **Regional ingredient mapping** (UK vs US terminology)
3. **Seasonal availability tracking**
4. **Integration with inventory system** for personalized recommendations

---

## Conclusion

The substitution enrichment initiative successfully expanded coverage from 29 to 52 ingredients, providing comprehensive substitution guidance for the most common ingredients in our recipe database. With 88%+ coverage on diverse recipes and <1ms lookup times, the system now offers practical, reliable substitution recommendations that align with our zero-waste mission.

The hybrid approach (static library + AI fallback) ensures both performance and flexibility, allowing the system to gracefully handle any ingredient while providing instant responses for common cases.

**Next Steps**: Proceed with user feedback gathering and database migration planning for Phase 2 expansion.

## Appendix: Sample Substitutions

### High-Confidence Examples

**Buttermilk → Milk + Lemon Juice** (0.95 confidence)
```
Ratio: 1 cup buttermilk = 1 cup milk + 1 tbsp lemon juice
Reason: Creates instant buttermilk substitute through acid curdling
Cooking Adjustment: Mix and let sit 5-10 minutes before using
```

**Tamari → Soy Sauce** (0.95 confidence)
```
Ratio: 1:1
Reason: Nearly identical flavor, gluten-free alternative
Cooking Adjustment: None needed
```

### Creative Substitutions

**Basil + Lime Zest → Cilantro** (0.5 confidence)
```
Ratio: 1 cup cilantro = 1 cup basil + 1 tsp lime zest
Reason: Provides freshness and citrus notes cilantro brings
Best For: Salads, fresh applications
Avoid For: Authentic Mexican/Thai dishes
```

**Cinnamon + Nutmeg + Cloves → Allspice** (0.9 confidence)
```
Ratio: 1 tsp allspice = 1/2 tsp cinnamon + 1/4 tsp nutmeg + 1/4 tsp cloves
Reason: Mimics the combination flavors allspice naturally has
Best For: Baking, pumpkin spice, Caribbean dishes
```
