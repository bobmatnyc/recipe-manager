# Recipe Extraction Progress Tracker

**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025
**Overall Progress**: 2% (Phase 1.1 Implementation Complete, Blocked)
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Public Domain Sources
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks estimated
**Target**: Scale from 4,343 to 10,000+ recipes

## Executive Summary

This tracker monitors the implementation of the Recipe Source Extraction plan to scale Joanie's Kitchen recipe database. The approach prioritizes legal certainty (public domain sources first), maintains strict attribution standards, and builds on existing Firecrawl integration.

- [ ] ⚠️ 0 recipes extracted (manual URL collection required)
- [ ] ❌ Extraction logs (blocked)
- [ ] ❌ Data quality report (blocked)

## Current Blockers

**Critical Blockers** (prevent work):
- None currently - ready to begin Phase 1

**Medium Blockers** (slow progress):
- CulinaryDB license verification required (Task 1.3)
- TheMealDB Patreon subscription needed (Task 2.1)
- ToS reviews must complete before prestige scraping (Task 3.1 blocks 3.3)

**Low Blockers** (minor delays):
- None currently

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ✅
- Phase 1: Public domain sources (USDA, universities)
- Phase 2: API integrations (clear licensing)
- Phase 5: Internal tooling (validation, import)
- Phase 6: Testing and deployment

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️
- Phase 3: Prestige sources (ToS compliance required)
- Phase 4: Specialized cuisines (ToS compliance required)
- CulinaryDB license verification

### High Risk Items 🔴
- None currently identified

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with low-risk public domain sources
- Complete comprehensive ToS reviews before prestige scraping
- Document all legal decisions
- Maintain attribution standards throughout
- Test extraction on small batches before full runs
