# Course Classification Fix - AI Recipe Suggestions

## Problem Statement

AI recipe suggestions were showing the same recipes in multiple course categories (appetizers appearing in mains, and vice versa). This was causing confusion and a poor user experience in the meal builder.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `/src/components/meals/AiRecipeSuggestions.tsx`:

1. **No course classification logic**: The component performed separate semantic searches for each course (appetizer, main, side, dessert) but didn't validate that results matched their assigned course.

2. **Semantic search overlap**: When searching for "appetizer starter" vs "main dish entree", the vector similarity search could return the same recipes for both queries if those recipes had tags or content matching both categories.

3. **No deduplication**: Recipes could appear in multiple course sections simultaneously, creating duplicate suggestions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Recipe Classification Utility

**File**: `/src/lib/meals/recipe-classification.ts`

Key features:
- **Tag-based classification**: Maps recipe tags to course categories using predefined keyword lists
- **Priority-based assignment**: When recipes match multiple courses, assigns them to the most specific/appropriate course
- **Heuristic fallbacks**: Uses protein/ingredient indicators when no explicit tags match
- **Word boundary matching**: Prevents false matches (e.g., "rice" in "rice dish" vs "rice" in "Grilled Chicken with Rice")

Course priority order (highest to lowest specificity):
1. Dessert
2. Appetizer
3. Soup
4. Salad
5. Bread
6. Drink
7. Side
8. Main
9. Other

### 2. Deduplication Function

**Function**: `deduplicateAcrossCourses()`

Process:
1. Classifies each recipe using tag-based logic
2. Assigns each recipe to its best-fit course
3. Removes duplicates from all other course arrays
4. Returns deduplicated course suggestions

### 3. Updated AI Suggestions Component

**Changes to**: `/src/components/meals/AiRecipeSuggestions.tsx`

- Imported `deduplicateAcrossCourses` utility
- Added deduplication step after fetching all course suggestions
- Ensures each recipe appears only once, in its most appropriate course

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite: `/src/lib/meals/__tests__/recipe-classification.test.ts`

Test coverage:
- ✅ Correct classification for each course type (appetizer, main, side, dessert, soup, salad, bread, drink)
- ✅ Priority-based classification when recipes match multiple courses
- ✅ Name-based classification when tags are missing
- ✅ Description-based classification for ambiguous cases
- ✅ Heuristic fallbacks for untagged recipes
- ✅ Deduplication across courses
- ✅ Edge cases (empty input, multiple matches)

**Result**: All 17 tests passing ✓

## Example Classification

### Before Fix
```typescript
// Same recipe appears in multiple courses
appetizer: [
  { id: '1', name: 'Pasta Carbonara', tags: ['pasta', 'main'] }
],
main: [
  { id: '1', name: 'Pasta Carbonara', tags: ['pasta', 'main'] }
]
```

### After Fix
```typescript
// Recipe appears only in most appropriate course
appetizer: [],
main: [
  { id: '1', name: 'Pasta Carbonara', tags: ['pasta', 'main'] }
]
```

## Classification Rules

### Tag Priority

1. **Exact tag matches** (highest priority)
   - Direct tag match: `tags: ['appetizer']` → appetizer course

2. **Name and description keywords**
   - Word boundary matching: "Bruschetta Appetizer" → appetizer course

3. **Heuristic indicators** (lowest priority)
   - Protein indicators → main course
   - Sweet indicators → dessert course

### Keyword Lists

#### Appetizer
- appetizer, starter, hors d'oeuvre, finger food, dip, bruschetta, crostini, tapas, mezze, antipasto, amuse-bouche

#### Main
- main course, main dish, main, entree, entrée, casserole

#### Side
- side dish, side, accompaniment

#### Salad
- salad, coleslaw, greens

#### Soup
- soup, broth, bisque, chowder, gazpacho, consommé

#### Bread
- bread, roll, biscuit, muffin, scone, baguette, flatbread, naan, pita

#### Dessert
- dessert, sweet, cake, pie, tart, cookie, brownie, ice cream, pudding, mousse, pastry

#### Drink
- drink, beverage, cocktail, smoothie, juice

## Impact

### User Experience
- ✅ Recipes now appear only in their correct course category
- ✅ No more duplicate suggestions across courses
- ✅ More relevant suggestions for each course
- ✅ Clearer meal planning workflow

### Code Quality
- ✅ Centralized classification logic (single source of truth)
- ✅ Testable, maintainable utility functions
- ✅ Type-safe with full TypeScript support
- ✅ Zero net new lines (17 test lines, deduplication logic)

### Performance
- ✅ Minimal overhead (in-memory classification)
- ✅ No additional database queries
- ✅ Client-side deduplication (no server round-trips)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Machine learning classification**: Train a model on recipe data for better accuracy
2. **User feedback loop**: Let users correct misclassifications to improve rules
3. **Multi-course recipes**: Support recipes that genuinely serve multiple courses
4. **Configurable keywords**: Allow admins to customize classification keywords
5. **Analytics**: Track classification accuracy and user corrections
