## Rationale

### Why Mobile Parity is Critical

1. **Traffic**: 60-70% of recipe site users are on mobile
2. **Context**: Users cook with phones/tablets in hand
3. **Retention**: Mobile experience is key to user satisfaction
4. **Foundation**: Prerequisite for PWA features (Version 0.8.0)
5. **Competition**: Modern recipe sites are mobile-first

### Why Before Advanced Features

- User discovery (0.5.0) needs mobile-friendly profiles/collections
- Social features (0.55.0) are primarily used on mobile
- Intelligence features (0.6.0) benefit from mobile context
- PWA features (0.8.0) require mobile foundation

**Philosophy**: Get the basics right before adding complexity.

## Impact Analysis

### User Impact

**Positive**:
- Seamless mobile experience
- Faster page loads
- Easier navigation and interaction
- Better accessibility
- Higher user retention

**Neutral**:
- No feature removal
- No breaking changes
- Existing desktop experience maintained

### Development Impact

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks (10 days)
**Complexity**: Medium (responsive CSS, performance optimization)
**Risk**: Low (mostly CSS/layout changes, no breaking changes)

### Timeline Impact

**Delay**: +1 month for all subsequent versions
**Justification**: Mobile experience is critical for recipe apps
**Benefit**: Stronger foundation for all future features

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not just improve mobile as we go?

**A**: Mobile parity requires systematic changes across the entire app. Doing it incrementally leads to inconsistent experiences and technical debt. It's better to establish a solid foundation now.

### Q: Can we parallelize with other features?

**A**: Not recommended. Mobile parity affects every component and page. Parallel development would cause conflicts and rework.

### Q: What if we skip mobile and go straight to PWA (0.8.0)?

**A**: PWA features require a solid mobile foundation. Skipping mobile parity would result in a poor PWA experience.

### Q: Is 1-2 weeks realistic?

**A**: Yes. Most changes are CSS/layout adjustments. No new features, no database changes. Focused scope makes this achievable.

### Q: What about existing mobile users?

**A**: They'll see immediate improvements. The app currently works on mobile but isn't optimized. This update ensures an excellent experience.
