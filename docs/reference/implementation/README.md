## Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for major features: `FEATURE_NAME_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Use kebab-case for system docs: `system-name.md`
- Append `_COMPLETE` for finished implementations
- Append `_IMPLEMENTATION` for implementation details

### Document Structure
Implementation documents should include:
1. **Overview** - Feature/system description
2. **Technical Details** - Architecture and design decisions
3. **Implementation** - Code changes and file locations
4. **Testing** - Test coverage and validation
5. **Deployment** - Deployment notes and considerations
6. **Future Work** - Planned enhancements

### Maintenance
- Update this README when adding new implementation docs
- Move superseded docs to `archive/` directory
- Update "Last Updated" timestamp when making changes
- Link related documents in "See Also" sections

## Quick Reference

### Finding Documentation
- **Features**: User-facing functionality → `features/`
- **Systems**: Core infrastructure → `systems/`
- **Data Import**: External integrations → `data-import/`
- **Historical**: Old implementations → `archive/`

### Contributing
When creating new implementation documentation:
1. Place in appropriate subdirectory (`features/`, `systems/`, or `data-import/`)
2. Follow naming conventions above
3. Update this README with link and description
4. Include all standard sections
