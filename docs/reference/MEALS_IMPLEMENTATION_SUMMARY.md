## 🚀 Usage Guide

### 1. Enhanced AI Suggestions

**Location**: `/meals/new` → "Build Meal" tab

**How to Use**:
1. Enter meal description (e.g., "Italian dinner for 4")
2. Add tags (e.g., "pasta", "comfort food")
3. Click "Filters" to set preferences:
   - Dietary: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.
   - Nutrition: high protein, vegetable-rich
   - Budget: set max budget ($10-$100)
   - Seasonal: prefer seasonal ingredients
4. Browse AI suggestions by course
5. Click "Add" to include in meal

**Smart Features**:
- Badges show "Seasonal", "Budget-Friendly", "High Protein"
- Warnings for dietary conflicts
- Match score (percentage) shows relevance
- Automatic deduplication across courses

### 2. Enhanced Shopping List

**Location**: `/meals/[id]` → "Generate Shopping List" button

**How It Works**:
1. Click "Generate Shopping List"
2. System consolidates all ingredients:
   - Converts units (2 cups + 16 tbsp = 3 cups)
   - Merges similar items (fresh milk + milk = milk)
   - Groups by category (produce, proteins, dairy)
3. View consolidated list with:
   - Quantity and unit (automatically optimized)
   - Category organization
   - Recipe sources (which recipes need this)
4. Check off items while shopping
5. Track progress with visual progress bar

**Advanced Features**:
- Unit conversion handles cups, tbsp, oz, lbs, grams, etc.
- Fuzzy matching: "chicken breast" + "boneless chicken breast" = same
- Serving multipliers applied automatically
- Price estimation ready (can be enhanced with LLM)

### 3. Meal Prep Timeline

**Location**: `/meals/[id]` → "Timeline" tab (add to detail page)

**How It Works**:
1. System analyzes all recipes in meal
2. Sorts by total time (longest first)
3. Works backwards from serving time
4. Detects equipment needs and conflicts
5. Identifies parallel tasks
6. Generates step-by-step timeline

**Timeline Features**:
- Time-based steps (T-120min, T-60min, T+0min)
- Step types (Start, Prep, Cook, Serve)
- Priority levels (Critical, Important, Optional)
- Equipment badges (Oven, Stove)
- Parallelization flags
- Conflict warnings with suggestions
- Pro tips for complex meals

**Example Use Case**:
*Thanksgiving Dinner with 5 recipes (turkey, stuffing, gravy, vegetables, pie)*

Timeline shows:
- Start 4 hours before serving
- Turkey prep and cooking (critical path)
- Parallel vegetable prep during turkey cooking
- Conflict: Pie and stuffing both need oven → suggested resolution
- Pro tip: Consider multiple oven racks

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **AI Suggestions**
   - No user profile integration yet (dietary preferences must be set each time)
   - Cuisine detection is keyword-based (not LLM-powered)
   - Price estimation is simplified (not actual market prices)
   - No caching of suggestions (redundant API calls)

2. **Shopping List**
   - Unit conversion doesn't handle all edge cases (e.g., "a pinch of salt")
   - Fuzzy matching threshold may need tuning (currently 85%)
   - No multi-store optimization (assumes single grocery trip)
   - No pantry checking (all items shown)

3. **Timeline**
   - Equipment detection is keyword-based (may miss complex instructions)
   - No manual timeline adjustment (can't reorder steps)
   - No timer integration (just shows times)
   - Doesn't account for cook skill level

4. **General**
   - No pagination on meals list (will be slow with 100+ meals)
   - No optimistic updates (UI lag on actions)
   - No undo/redo functionality
   - No export to PDF/print-friendly format

### Future Fixes
- Add user profile for persistent dietary preferences
- Implement LLM-powered cuisine detection
- Add Redis caching for AI suggestions
- Improve unit conversion with comprehensive lookup table
- Add manual timeline editing
- Implement optimistic UI updates
