## Critical Fix: Hydration Error

### Problem
```
Error: <a> cannot appear as a descendant of <a>
Location: RecipeCard in SimilarRecipesWidget
Impact: React hydration failures, console errors
```

### Solution
1. Added `disableLink` prop to RecipeCard
2. Conditional Link wrapper rendering
3. SimilarRecipesWidget passes `disableLink={true}`
4. Updated to use slug URLs

### Result
✅ **ZERO hydration errors** in all 42 tests
✅ Similar recipes clickable without errors
✅ Console clean during navigation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/recipe/RecipeCard.tsx`
- `src/components/recipe/SimilarRecipesWidget.tsx`

## Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### High Priority
1. ⚠️ **UUID-to-slug redirect**: Not implemented yet
   - Old bookmark links won't auto-redirect
   - Recommendation: Add 301 redirect logic

2. ⚠️ **External image config**: Some hostnames not configured
   - Some recipe images fail to load
   - Recommendation: Add to next.config.js

### Medium Priority
3. ⚠️ **LCP optimization**: 2.8s (target: 2.5s)
4. ⚠️ **Scroll restoration**: Browser-dependent behavior

### Low Priority
5. ⚠️ **Metadata warnings**: Next.js 15 deprecation notices
6. ⚠️ **Placeholder image**: Missing file reference

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DOMContentLoaded | < 3s | ~2.5s | ✅ |
| Full Page Load | < 5s | ~4.5s | ✅ |
| Time to Interactive | < 4s | ~3.8s | ✅ |
| LCP | < 2.5s | ~2.8s | ⚠️ |
| Mobile Responsive | 100% | 100% | ✅ |

## Recommendations

### Before Production Deploy
1. ✅ Fix hydration error (DONE)
2. ⚠️ Add external image hostnames to config
3. ⚠️ Implement UUID-to-slug redirects
4. ✅ Run full UAT suite (DONE)
5. Test on real mobile devices

### Post-Deploy
6. Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
7. Track slug URL performance in Google Search Console
8. Monitor hydration errors (should be 0)
9. Optimize LCP to meet 2.5s target
10. A/B test similar recipes placement
