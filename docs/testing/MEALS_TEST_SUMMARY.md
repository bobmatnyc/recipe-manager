## Running Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all meals tests
pnpm test:e2e:meals

# Run with interactive UI
pnpm test:e2e:meals:ui

# Run in debug mode
pnpm test:e2e:meals:debug

# Run with browser visible
pnpm test:e2e:meals:headed

# Run UAT tests (chromium only)
pnpm test:uat:meals
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Specific test file
pnpm test:e2e:meals -- meal-creation

# Specific test by name
pnpm test:e2e:meals -- -g "should create a new meal"

# Tests matching pattern
pnpm test:e2e:meals -- -g "delete"
```

---

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
# Test User Credentials
TEST_USER_EMAIL=test@example.com
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=yourSecurePassword123
```

⚠️ **Important**: Create a dedicated test user in Clerk. Do not use production accounts.

### 2. Database Requirements

- Recipes must exist in database for search functionality
- Test user must have valid Clerk authentication
- Clean database state recommended for consistent results

### 3. Application State

The dev server must be running on `http://localhost:3002`.

Tests will automatically start the server if not running (configured in `playwright.config.ts`).

---

## Test Architecture

### Authentication Strategy

**Setup Phase** (`auth.setup.ts`):
1. Runs before all tests (once)
2. Authenticates test user via Clerk sign-in flow
3. Saves auth state to `tests/e2e/.auth/user.json`
4. Reused across all tests (no repeated sign-ins)

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Fast execution (auth once, use many times)
- 🎯 Consistent auth state
- 💰 Conserves Clerk API rate limits

### Data Management

**Test Fixtures** (`fixtures/test-data.ts`):
- Reusable test data objects (meals, templates, recipes)
- Helper functions for common operations
- Unique name generators to prevent conflicts

**Cleanup Strategy**:
- Tests track created meals in `createdMealNames` array
- `afterAll` hook cleans up test data
- Prevents database pollution

**Example Cleanup**:
```typescript
test.afterAll(async ({ browser }) => {
  if (createdMealNames.length > 0) {
    const context = await browser.newContext({
      storageState: 'tests/e2e/.auth/user.json',
    });
    const page = await context.newPage();
    await cleanupTestMeals(page, createdMealNames);
    await context.close();
  }
});
```

### UAT-Style Testing

Each test includes:

1. **Business Value**: What business objective does this validate?
2. **User Story**: What user need is being tested?
3. **Success Criteria**: What must work for test to pass?

**Example**:
```typescript
test('should generate shopping list from meal', async ({ page }) => {
  /**
   * Business Value: Automated grocery planning
   *
   * User Story: As a home cook, I want to generate a shopping list
   *             so that I know exactly what ingredients to buy
   *
   * Success Criteria:
   * - Shopping list can be generated
   * - Ingredients are consolidated
   * - List is associated with meal
   */

  // Test implementation...
});
```

    pnpm test:e2e:meals --workers=1
  env:
    TEST_USER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.TEST_USER_EMAIL }}
    TEST_USER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TEST_USER_PASSWORD }}
```

---

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Achieved

- ✅ All major user journeys tested
- ✅ Happy path + error cases covered
- ✅ Form validation tested
- ✅ Data persistence verified
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility
- ✅ Mobile and desktop viewports

### Quality Indicators

- 🎯 Clear test structure and naming
- 🎯 Self-documenting code
- 🎯 Reusable fixtures and helpers
- 🎯 Comprehensive error handling
- 🎯 Business value documentation

### Performance

- ⚡ Auth setup runs once (< 10 seconds)
- ⚡ Individual tests < 30 seconds
- ⚡ Full suite < 5 minutes (parallel)

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Create test file in `tests/e2e/meals/`
2. Follow UAT pattern (Business Value → User Story → Success Criteria)
3. Use fixtures from `fixtures/test-data.ts`
4. Add cleanup in `afterAll` hook
5. Update this summary

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Failures
**Solution**: Verify `.env.local` credentials, check Clerk dashboard, delete auth state and re-run

#### Missing Test Data
**Solution**: Ensure recipes exist, run database seeders, verify user permissions

#### Flaky Tests
**Solution**: Add `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`, use specific selectors, increase timeouts
