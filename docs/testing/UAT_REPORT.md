## Critical Issue Resolution

### Hydration Error: Nested `<a>` Tags

**Problem Identified**:
```
Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <a> cannot appear as a descendant of <a>
Location: RecipeCard component wrapped in Link by SimilarRecipesWidget
```

**Root Cause**:
- `SimilarRecipesWidget` wrapped `RecipeCard` in a `<Link>` component
- `RecipeCard` internally also created a `<Link>` wrapper
- Result: Nested `<a>` tags causing React hydration mismatch

**Solution Implemented**:

1. Added `disableLink` prop to `RecipeCard`:
```typescript
interface RecipeCardProps {
  recipe: Recipe;
  showSimilarity?: boolean;
  similarity?: number;
  showRank?: number;
  disableLink?: boolean; // NEW
}
```

2. Refactored `RecipeCard` to conditionally render Link wrapper:
```typescript
const cardContent = (
  <Card className="recipe-card h-full...">
    {/* Card contents */}
  </Card>
);

if (disableLink) {
  return cardContent; // No Link wrapper
}

return (
  <Link href={recipeUrl} className="group block h-full">
    {cardContent}
  </Link>
);
```

3. Updated `SimilarRecipesWidget` to pass `disableLink`:
```typescript
<Link href={recipeUrl} className="block">
  <div className="relative">
    <RecipeCard recipe={recipe} disableLink />
    {/* Similarity badge */}
  </div>
</Link>
```

4. Updated slug URL resolution:
```typescript
const recipeUrl = recipe.slug ? `/recipes/${recipe.slug}` : `/recipes/${recipe.id}`;
```

**Verification**: ✅ No more hydration errors in console logs during testing
