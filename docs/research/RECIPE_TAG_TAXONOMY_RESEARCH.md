## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research analyzed recipe tag hierarchies and taxonomies across major recipe platforms, culinary databases, and industry standards. The goal was to evaluate our current tag ontology against best practices and recommend improvements for better recipe organization, discoverability, and user experience.

### Key Findings

1. **Our current system is well-aligned with industry standards** - We have 10 semantic categories matching what major platforms use
2. **Hierarchy depth should be 2-3 levels maximum** - Most platforms avoid deep nesting for usability
3. **Optimal tag count: 2-5 tags per recipe** - SEO research confirms this range for discoverability
4. **Difficulty should remain as tags** - Current implementation is correct; it's context-dependent (not intrinsic)
5. **Course vs Meal Type confusion exists industry-wide** - We need clearer definitions
6. **Regional cuisine hierarchies are valuable** - Italian → Sicilian pattern is standard practice

---

## 1. Industry Analysis: Major Recipe Sites

### 1.1 Schema.org Recipe Standard

**Official Standard**: https://schema.org/Recipe

Schema.org defines the web standard for recipe structured data, used by Google, Bing, and other search engines.

**Key Properties**:
- `recipeCuisine`: Regional cuisine type (e.g., "French", "Mediterranean", "Ethiopian")
- `recipeCategory`: Type of meal or course (e.g., "dinner", "entree", "dessert, snack")
- `recipeIngredient`: List of ingredients
- `recipeInstructions`: Step-by-step instructions
- `suitableForDiet`: Dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, halal, kosher, etc.)
- `keywords`: Descriptive terms ("quick", "easy", "authentic", seasonal/holiday tags)
- `prepTime` / `cookTime`: Time durations (ISO 8601 format)

**Insight**: Schema.org separates cuisine, category, diet, and keywords - supporting our multi-category approach.

---

### 1.2 NYT Cooking

**Tag System**:
- **Primary Categories**: Cuisine, Main Ingredients, Dietary preferences
- **Dietary Tags**: Vegetarian, Vegan, Dairy-Free, Gluten-Free
- **Search Filters**: Diet, cuisine, meal type, ingredient, time
- **User Organization**: Custom folders + system-generated categories (Breakfast, Dessert, Vegetarian)
- **Database Size**: 20,000+ recipes

**Key Features**:
- Personalized recommendations based on diet tag similarity
- Advanced search across multiple dimensions
- Both system tags and user custom tags

**Takeaway**: Hybrid approach - structured system tags + user customization

---

### 1.3 AllRecipes, Food Network, Bon Appétit, Serious Eats

**Common Categories** (found across multiple platforms):
- Appetizer, Condiment, Dessert, Drink
- Main, Side, Snack
- Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten-Free
- Cuisine types (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, etc.)
- Cooking methods

**Apple News+ Integration** (2025):
- Aggregates recipes from AllRecipes, Bon Appétit, Food & Wine, Serious Eats
- **Unified Search Filters**:
  - Ingredient
  - Time to complete
  - Simplicity/difficulty
  - Type of cuisine
  - Other contextual options

**Takeaway**: Industry consensus on core categories; platforms differentiate on UX, not taxonomy

---

### 1.4 Recipe Management Systems

**Plan to Eat** recommends 4 organizational dimensions:
1. **Course**: Appetizer, Breakfast, Dessert, Dinner, Lunch, Salad, Side, Snack, Soup
2. **Cuisine**: American, Asian, French, Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, Mexican, etc.
3. **Rating**: User ratings (1-5 stars)
4. **Tags**: Flexible custom tags for characteristics not fitting Course/Cuisine

**Eat Your Books** (Recipe Index Service):
- 150+ recipe type categories
- Hierarchical browsing (e.g., Breakfast → Pancakes → Buttermilk Pancakes)
- Focus on granular categorization for large collections

**MasterCook**:
- Primary categories + subcategories
- Hierarchical structure (Category → Subcategory → Recipe)

**Takeaway**: Professional systems use 3-4 primary dimensions + flexible tagging

---

## 2. Culinary Taxonomy Standards

### 2.1 FoodOn Ontology

**What it is**: A consortium-driven, farm-to-fork ontology for global food classification
**Website**: https://foodon.org
**Scope**: 9,600+ generic food product categories

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Parent-child taxonomic relationships
- **Multi-domain**: Covers plant/animal taxonomy, anatomy, common names, food products
- **Formal Axioms**: Defines relationships between entities
- **Global Coverage**: Addresses food description across cultures worldwide
- **Not Strictly Hierarchical**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) - items can have multiple parents

**Structure Example**:
```
Food Product
├── Plant-based Food
│   ├── Vegetable Food Product
│   │   ├── Leafy Vegetable
│   │   └── Root Vegetable
│   └── Fruit Food Product
├── Animal-based Food
│   ├── Meat Food Product
│   └── Dairy Food Product
└── Processed Food Product
```

**Use Cases**: Food traceability, safety, nutrition research, supply chain management

**Insight**: Formal ontologies are powerful but overly complex for user-facing recipe apps. Our lightweight approach is appropriate.

---

### 2.2 USDA Food Classification

**What We Eat in America (WWEIA)**:
- **3-Level Hierarchy**: Food Category → Food Subcategory → Individual Food Code
- **Purpose**: Dietary research and nutrition analysis
- **Example**: Dairy → Cheese → Cheddar Cheese (8-digit code)

**MyPlate (Consumer Education)**:
- **5 Food Groups**: Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, Protein Foods, Dairy
- **Subgroups**: Emphasize nutrient-rich foods within groups
- **Purpose**: Public health guidance, not recipe categorization

**Takeaway**: USDA systems focus on nutrition, not culinary use. Not directly applicable to recipe tags.

---

### 2.3 Schema.org Keywords Property

The `keywords` property in Schema.org Recipe is the most relevant standard:

**Recommended Keywords**:
- Season (spring, summer, fall, winter)
- Holiday (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter)
- Descriptors (quick, easy, authentic, comfort food, crowd-pleaser)
- Cooking method (baked, grilled, no-cook)
- Special occasions (birthday, party, potluck)

**Format**: Comma-separated text string
**SEO Impact**: High - Google uses these for recipe discovery

**Takeaway**: Our "tags" field aligns with Schema.org keywords

---

## 3. Common Hierarchical Patterns

### 3.1 Cuisine Hierarchies

**Standard Pattern**: Country/Region → Subregion → Dish Type

#### Example: Italian Cuisine
```
Italian
├── Northern Italian
│   ├── Piedmontese
│   ├── Lombard
│   └── Venetian
├── Central Italian
│   ├── Tuscan
│   ├── Roman
│   └── Umbrian
└── Southern Italian
    ├── Neapolitan
    ├── Sicilian
    └── Calabrian
```

**Key Insights**:
- Italian cuisine is primarily regional, not national
- Each region has distinct ingredients, techniques, traditions
- Sicily has Greek, Spanish, Jewish, Maghrebi, Arab influences (multi-parent DAG)
- Neapolitan pizza is UNESCO intangible cultural heritage
- Most recipe sites stop at 1-2 levels (Italian → Sicilian) for usability

**Our Implementation**: ✅ Correct - We define Sicilian as child of Italian

---

#### Example: Asian Cuisine (Complex Multi-Region)
```
Asian
├── East Asian
│   ├── Chinese
│   │   ├── Cantonese
│   │   ├── Szechuan
│   │   └── Hunan
│   ├── Japanese
│   └── Korean
├── Southeast Asian
│   ├── Thai
│   ├── Vietnamese
│   └── Indonesian
└── South Asian
    ├── Indian
    └── Pakistani
```

**Issue**: "Asian" is too broad; most sites skip it and go directly to country-level
**Our Implementation**: ✅ We list Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese separately (no parent "Asian")

---

### 3.2 Dietary Restriction Hierarchies

**Standard Pattern**: Least restrictive → Most restrictive

```
Dietary Preferences
├── Omnivore (no restrictions)
├── Pescatarian (no meat except fish)
├── Vegetarian (no meat, poultry, fish)
│   └── Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian (includes dairy & eggs)
│       ├── Lacto-Vegetarian (dairy only)
│       └── Ovo-Vegetarian (eggs only)
└── Vegan (no animal products)
    └── Whole Food Plant-Based (minimally processed)
```

**Hierarchy Relationship**:
- Vegan ⊂ Vegetarian (all vegan recipes are vegetarian)
- Vegetarian ⊂ Pescatarian (all vegetarian recipes are pescatarian-friendly)
- Pescatarian ⊂ Omnivore

**Practical Application**:
- If recipe is tagged "vegan", it's automatically vegetarian-friendly
- Filtering for "vegetarian" should include vegan recipes
- Our current implementation treats these as independent tags

**Recommendation**: Add hierarchical relationship support

---

### 3.3 Cooking Method Taxonomy

**Professional Culinary Classification**:

```
Cooking Methods
├── Dry Heat Methods (no liquid, uses air or fat)
│   ├── Baking/Roasting (oven, 300-450°F)
│   ├── Sautéing/Pan Frying (stovetop, small amount fat)
│   ├── Stir-Frying (high heat, constant motion)
│   ├── Deep Frying (submerged in hot oil)
│   ├── Grilling/Broiling (direct heat from below/above)
│   └── Searing (very high heat, browning)
├── Moist Heat Methods (uses water, liquid, or steam)
│   ├── Boiling (212°F, rapid bubbles)
│   ├── Simmering (185-205°F, gentle bubbles)
│   ├── Poaching (160-180°F, no bubbles)
│   ├── Steaming (steam heat, no water contact)
│   └── Blanching (brief boil, ice bath)
└── Combination Methods (dry + moist)
    ├── Braising (sear + liquid simmer)
    ├── Stewing (similar to braising, smaller pieces)
    └── Pot Roasting (sear + oven with liquid)
```

**Key Insight**: Professional culinary schools teach 3-tier method classification

**Our Implementation**: Flat list (no parent categories)
- ✅ Pros: Simpler for users, avoids confusion
- ❌ Cons: Misses educational opportunity, harder to filter "all dry heat methods"

**Recommendation**: Consider adding parent categories as optional filters

---

### 3.4 Ingredient Hierarchies

**Example: Protein Classification**
```
Protein
├── Meat
│   ├── Red Meat
│   │   ├── Beef
│   │   ├── Pork
│   │   └── Lamb
│   └── Poultry
│       ├── Chicken
│       ├── Turkey
│       └── Duck
├── Seafood
│   ├── Fish
│   │   ├── Salmon
│   │   ├── Tuna
│   │   └── Cod
│   └── Shellfish
│       ├── Shrimp
│       ├── Crab
│       └── Lobster
└── Plant-Based Protein
    ├── Legumes (beans, lentils)
    ├── Tofu/Tempeh
    └── Nuts/Seeds
```

**Our Implementation**:
- We define `seafood` with children: `salmon`, `shrimp`, `tuna` ✅
- We don't have a parent "Meat" category
- We don't have a parent "Protein" category

**Industry Practice**: Most sites use flat ingredient tags, not hierarchies
**Recommendation**: Current flat approach is standard

---

## 4. Category Depth Analysis

### 4.1 Optimal Hierarchy Depth

**Research Findings**:

| Depth | Use Case | Examples | User Experience |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **1 Level (Flat)** | Simple browsing | Tags, keywords | ✅ Best for mobile, quick filtering |
| **2 Levels** | Balanced organization | Cuisine → Regional | ✅ Most common, good UX |
| **3 Levels** | Detailed classification | FoodOn, USDA | ⚠️ Requires training, complex UI |
| **4+ Levels** | Academic/Research | Formal ontologies | ❌ Too complex for consumers |

**Recommendation**: **Maximum 2-3 levels** for consumer-facing recipe apps

---

### 4.2 Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Problem**: Some tags span multiple categories

**Example: "Quick"**
- Is it a **Time** tag? (Yes - under 30 minutes)
- Is it a **Difficulty** tag? (Yes - quick often means easy)
- Is it a **Keyword** tag? (Yes - descriptor)

**Solution Patterns**:

1. **Single Category Assignment** (our current approach)
   - Assign to most relevant category (Time)
   - ✅ Simple, no duplication
   - ❌ May feel arbitrary

2. **Multi-Category Tags**
   - Allow tags to belong to multiple categories
   - ✅ More accurate representation
   - ❌ Complex implementation, confusing UI

3. **Separate Concepts**
   - "Quick" (time) vs "Easy" (difficulty)
   - ✅ Precise, unambiguous
   - ❌ Users may use interchangeably

**Recommendation**: Keep current single-category approach; add synonyms to handle multi-meaning tags

---

## 5. Current Implementation Analysis

### 5.1 Our Tag Ontology Structure

**10 Categories**:
1. **Cuisine** - Regional/national cooking styles (22 tags)
2. **Meal Type** - When dish is eaten (10 tags)
3. **Dietary** - Dietary restrictions/preferences (15 tags)
4. **Cooking Method** - How dish is prepared (17 tags)
5. **Main Ingredient** - Primary ingredient focus (20 tags)
6. **Course** - Type of dish/course (13 tags)
7. **Season** - Seasonal/holiday-specific (12 tags)
8. **Difficulty** - Skill level required (7 tags)
9. **Time** - Time commitment (8 tags)
10. **Other** - Catchall for uncategorized

**Total**: 124 semantic tags defined

---

### 5.2 Strengths of Current System

✅ **Well-aligned with industry standards**
- Matches Schema.org properties (cuisine, category, diet, keywords)
- Covers same categories as major platforms (NYT, AllRecipes)
- Flat structure within categories (appropriate for consumer use)

✅ **Hierarchical support built-in**
- `hierarchy.parent` and `hierarchy.children` properties
- Currently used for: Italian → Sicilian, Vegetarian → Vegan, Seafood → Salmon/Shrimp/Tuna

✅ **Synonym support**
- Maps "plant-based" → "vegan", "bbq" → "grilled", "italy" → "italian"
- Prevents duplicate tags with different names

✅ **Popularity-weighted search**
- High-usage tags surface first in autocomplete
- Aligns with SEO best practices (common tags = better discoverability)

✅ **Category-based visual grouping**
- Color-coded badges improve scannability
- Users can quickly identify tag types

✅ **Backward compatible**
- No database migration required
- Existing plain-text tags work seamlessly
- Gradual normalization as recipes are edited

---

### 5.3 Gaps and Misalignments

#### Gap 1: Course vs Meal Type Confusion

**Current State**:
- **Meal Type**: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Dessert, Appetizer, Brunch, Side, Main
- **Course**: Main Course, Side Dish, Salad, Soup, Sauce, Sandwich, Pizza

**Problem**: Overlap and inconsistency
- "Appetizer" in Meal Type vs not in Course
- "Dessert" in Meal Type vs not in Course
- "Side" in Meal Type vs "Side Dish" in Course
- "Main" in Meal Type vs "Main Course" in Course

**Industry Standard**:
- **Meal Type**: When eaten (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Brunch)
- **Course**: Position in meal sequence (Appetizer, Main Course, Side Dish, Dessert)
- **Dish Type**: Form factor (Soup, Salad, Sandwich, Pizza, Casserole)

**Recommendation**:
1. Remove "Appetizer", "Dessert", "Side", "Main" from Meal Type
2. Add "Appetizer" and "Dessert" to Course
3. Consider creating new "Dish Type" category for Soup, Salad, Sandwich, Pizza

---

#### Gap 2: Difficulty as Tag vs Field

**Current State**: Difficulty is a tag category (Easy, Medium, Hard, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Quick)

**Industry Patterns**:
- **NYT Cooking**: Difficulty is a separate field + filter (not a tag)
- **AllRecipes**: Difficulty rating is user-submitted (like rating)
- **Schema.org**: No difficulty property (not part of standard)
- **CDKitchen**: Numerical scale 1-5 considering steps, ingredients, methods, tools

**Our Database Schema**: Recipes have a `difficulty` field (easy | medium | hard)

**Problem**:
- Difficulty is in BOTH tags and database field
- Redundant data
- "Quick" is in difficulty tags (should be in Time)
- Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced overlaps with Easy/Medium/Hard

**Recommendation**:
1. **KEEP difficulty as database field** (it's intrinsic to recipe, not a tag)
2. **REMOVE difficulty tags** from tag ontology
3. Use database field for filtering, not tags
4. Move "Quick" to Time category only

---

#### Gap 3: Time Tags Need Clarity

**Current State**: Quick, Medium, Long, Under 30 Minutes, 30-60 Minutes, Over 1 Hour, Make-Ahead, Overnight

**Problem**:
- "Quick" overlaps with "Under 30 Minutes"
- "Medium" is vague (30-60 min?)
- "Make-Ahead" is a planning strategy, not a time duration
- "Overnight" is ambiguous (8-12 hours? Or just sits overnight?)

**Industry Standard**:
- **Explicit Time Ranges**: "Under 30 min", "30-60 min", "1-2 hours", "2+ hours"
- **Planning Tags**: "Make-Ahead", "Freezer-Friendly", "Meal Prep", "Batch Cooking"
- **Passive Time Tags**: "Overnight (passive)", "Marinate 4+ hours"

**Recommendation**:
1. **Active Time Tags**: Under 15 min, 15-30 min, 30-60 min, 1-2 hours, 2+ hours
2. **Planning Tags**: Make-Ahead, Freezer-Friendly, Meal Prep
3. Remove vague "Quick", "Medium", "Long"

---

#### Gap 4: Missing Regional Cuisines

**Current Cuisines** (22): Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, French, Thai, Mediterranean, American, Greek, Korean, Vietnamese, Spanish, Middle Eastern, Brazilian, Caribbean, German, British, Irish, Ethiopian, Moroccan, Turkish

**Missing Major Cuisines**:
- **Southeast Asian**: Filipino, Malaysian, Indonesian (we only have Thai, Vietnamese)
- **African**: Nigerian, Egyptian, Senegalese
- **European**: Polish, Russian, Portuguese, Swiss, Austrian
- **Latin American**: Peruvian, Argentine, Colombian, Cuban
- **Middle Eastern (specific)**: Lebanese, Israeli, Iranian (we have generic "Middle Eastern")
- **Fusion**: Asian Fusion, Latin Fusion, etc.

**Recommendation**: Add on-demand as users request; don't pre-populate all cuisines

---

#### Gap 5: Cooking Methods Missing Modern Appliances

**Current Methods** (17): Baked, Grilled, Fried, Steamed, Roasted, Slow-Cooked, Instant Pot, Air Fryer, Pressure Cooker, Sautéed, Broiled, Poached, Braised, Stir-Fried, Smoked, No-Cook, Raw

**Missing Modern Methods**:
- Sous Vide (popular in home cooking now)
- Microwave (commonly used, even if not gourmet)
- Toaster Oven
- Electric Skillet
- Rice Cooker

**Missing Traditional Methods**:
- Fermented
- Cured
- Pickled
- Dehydrated/Dried

**Recommendation**: Add "Sous Vide", "Fermented", consider others based on usage

---

#### Gap 6: Dietary Tags Missing Common Diets

**Current Dietary Tags** (15): Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, Low-Carb, Keto, Paleo, Whole30, Sugar-Free, Nut-Free, Low-Fat, High-Protein, Low-Sodium, Halal, Kosher

**Missing Common Diets**:
- Pescatarian (fish but no meat)
- Flexitarian (mostly plant-based)
- FODMAP-Friendly (IBS diet)
- Diabetic-Friendly
- Heart-Healthy
- Kid-Friendly (not a restriction, but common tag)

**Missing Allergen Tags**:
- Egg-Free
- Soy-Free
- Shellfish-Free
- Sesame-Free (now a major allergen in US)

**Recommendation**: Add Pescatarian, Egg-Free, Soy-Free; consider others on-demand

---

## 6. Tag Count Recommendations

### 6.1 SEO Research Findings

**Optimal Tags Per Recipe**: **2-5 tags**

**Research Sources**:
- Ghost CMS best practices: 2-5 tags per post
- WordPress SEO guides: 2-5 tags recommended
- Recipe SEO case studies: 3-5 tags optimal for discoverability

**Why This Range?**
- ✅ Enough to describe recipe comprehensively
- ✅ Not so many that they dilute SEO signal
- ✅ Easy for users to scan visually
- ❌ 1 tag: Too limiting, misses important attributes
- ❌ 10+ tags: Overwhelming, unfocused, poor SEO

---

### 6.2 Tag Distribution by Category

**Recommended Mix** (for 5 tags):
1. **1 Cuisine tag** (e.g., Italian)
2. **1 Meal Type or Course tag** (e.g., Dinner, Main Course)
3. **1 Dietary/Ingredient tag** (e.g., Vegetarian, Chicken)
4. **1 Method/Time tag** (e.g., Baked, Quick)
5. **1 Special tag** (e.g., Holiday, Comfort Food)

**Example**:
- Recipe: "Baked Chicken Parmesan"
- Tags: `Italian`, `Dinner`, `Chicken`, `Baked`, `Comfort Food`
- Count: 5 tags across 5 categories ✅

**Bad Example**:
- Tags: `Italian`, `Sicilian`, `Tuscan`, `Mediterranean`, `European`, `Neapolitan`
- Problem: All cuisine tags, no other dimensions, over-specified

---

### 6.3 Current Implementation

**Our System**: `maxTags={20}` in SemanticTagInput component

**Recommendation**:
- **Reduce to `maxTags={8}`** (still flexible, but encourages focus)
- **Add UI hint**: "Select 3-5 tags for best discoverability"
- **Show warning** if user exceeds 8 tags

---

## 7. Recommended Hierarchy Structure

### 7.1 Top-Level Categories (Revised)

**Proposed Structure** (11 categories):

| Category | Purpose | Depth | Example Tags |
|----------|---------|-------|--------------|
| **Cuisine** | Regional/cultural origin | 2 levels | Italian → Sicilian |
| **Meal Type** | When dish is eaten | Flat | Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Brunch |
| **Course** | Position in meal | Flat | Appetizer, Main Course, Side Dish, Dessert |
| **Dish Type** | Form/structure | Flat | Soup, Salad, Sandwich, Pizza, Casserole, Bowl |
| **Dietary** | Restrictions/preferences | 2 levels | Vegetarian → Vegan |
| **Cooking Method** | Technique/appliance | 2 levels | Dry Heat → Baking, Moist Heat → Steaming |
| **Main Ingredient** | Primary ingredient | 2 levels | Protein → Chicken, Vegetables → Leafy Greens |
| **Season/Holiday** | Temporal context | Flat | Spring, Summer, Thanksgiving, Christmas |
| **Planning** | Meal prep strategy | Flat | Make-Ahead, Freezer-Friendly, Meal Prep, Batch |
| **Characteristics** | Descriptors | Flat | Comfort Food, Kid-Friendly, Party, Healthy, Spicy |
| **Other** | Uncategorized | Flat | Catchall |

**Changes from Current**:
1. ✅ **NEW**: Separated "Dish Type" from "Course" (Soup, Salad, Pizza, etc.)
2. ✅ **NEW**: "Planning" category for meal prep tags
3. ✅ **NEW**: "Characteristics" for descriptive tags (Comfort Food, Kid-Friendly)
4. ❌ **REMOVED**: "Difficulty" (moved to database field)
5. ❌ **REMOVED**: "Time" duration tags (use prepTime/cookTime fields instead)
6. ✅ **KEPT**: Season/Holiday combined (temporal context)

## 8. Migration Path

### 8.1 Current State Assessment

**Database**:
- Tags stored as JSON array of strings in `recipes.tags` field
- No database changes required

**Code**:
- `tag-ontology.ts`: 10 categories, 124 tags
- `semantic-tags.ts`: Full tag definitions with metadata
- Components: SemanticTagInput, SemanticTagDisplay

**Status**: ✅ System is functional and production-ready

---

### 8.2 Recommended Changes (Phased)

#### Phase 1: Category Refinement (Non-Breaking)

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Add "Dish Type" category (Soup, Salad, Sandwich, Pizza, Casserole, Bowl)
2. ✅ Add "Planning" category (Make-Ahead, Freezer-Friendly, Meal Prep, Batch Cooking)
3. ✅ Add "Characteristics" category (Comfort Food, Kid-Friendly, Healthy, Spicy, Party)
4. ✅ Move "Make-Ahead" and "Overnight" from Time to Planning
5. ✅ Clean up Meal Type: Remove "Appetizer", "Dessert", "Side", "Main"
6. ✅ Clean up Course: Add "Appetizer", "Dessert"

**Impact**:
- No data migration required
- Existing tags continue to work
- New tags available immediately
- Components auto-update with new categories

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours

---

#### Phase 2: Hierarchy Enhancement (Breaking Change)

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Add parent categories to Cooking Method (Dry Heat, Moist Heat, Combination)
2. ✅ Add parent categories to Main Ingredient (Protein, Grains, Vegetables)
3. ✅ Expand cuisine hierarchies (Chinese → Cantonese/Szechuan, Indian → North/South)
4. ✅ Add Dietary hierarchies (Allergen-Free → Dairy-Free/Nut-Free/etc.)

**Impact**:
- Filtering logic may need updates (e.g., "Dry Heat" should include all child methods)
- UI may need tree navigation for browsing hierarchies
- Backward compatible: existing tags remain valid

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

---

#### Phase 3: Difficulty Migration (Breaking Change)

**Tasks**:
1. ❌ REMOVE Difficulty category from tag ontology
2. ✅ Ensure all recipes have `difficulty` field populated (easy | medium | hard)
3. ✅ Update recipe filters to use difficulty field, not tags
4. ✅ Data migration: If any recipes have difficulty tags, convert to field

**Impact**:
- **BREAKING**: Recipes tagged with "Easy", "Medium", "Hard" will need field update
- Database migration script required
- Filters and UI need refactoring

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day (includes migration script)

**Migration Script**:
```typescript
// Pseudo-code
for each recipe:
  if 'easy' or 'beginner' in tags:
    set difficulty = 'easy'
    remove difficulty tags
  if 'medium' or 'intermediate' in tags:
    set difficulty = 'medium'
    remove difficulty tags
  if 'hard' or 'advanced' in tags:
    set difficulty = 'hard'
    remove difficulty tags
```

---

#### Phase 4: Time Tag Cleanup (Non-Breaking)

**Tasks**:
1. ❌ REMOVE vague time tags ("Quick", "Medium", "Long")
2. ✅ Rely on `prepTime` and `cookTime` database fields
3. ✅ Add computed "Total Time" filters in UI (< 30min, 30-60min, 1-2hr, 2hr+)
4. ✅ KEEP planning tags in new "Planning" category

**Impact**:
- Some existing "Quick" tags become orphaned (auto-categorized to "Other")
- Users encouraged to rely on time fields, not tags
- Better precision (exact minutes vs vague labels)

**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours

---

#### Phase 5: Add Missing Tags (Non-Breaking)

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Add Pescatarian, Egg-Free, Soy-Free dietary tags
2. ✅ Add Sous Vide, Fermenting cooking methods
3. ✅ Add regional cuisines on-demand (Peruvian, Lebanese, etc.)
4. ✅ Review and add popular tags based on user requests

**Impact**:
- Improved tag coverage
- Better discoverability for niche diets/methods
- No breaking changes

**Estimated Effort**: Ongoing (2-4 hours per batch)

---

## 9. Category Definitions (Revised)

### Cuisine
**Definition**: The regional, national, or cultural origin of a dish's cooking tradition and flavor profile.

**Examples**: Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Mediterranean, Southern (US)

**Guidelines**:
- Use most specific region user recognizes (Sicilian > Italian if distinct)
- Avoid overly broad tags (e.g., "Asian" → use "Chinese", "Japanese" instead)
- Fusion cuisines are valid (e.g., "Tex-Mex", "Asian Fusion")

---

### Meal Type
**Definition**: The time of day or social context when a dish is typically consumed.

**Examples**: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Brunch

**Guidelines**:
- Based on when dish is eaten, not its position in a meal sequence
- Can have multiple (e.g., "Breakfast" and "Brunch" for pancakes)
- Distinct from Course (position in meal) and Dish Type (form factor)

---

### Course
**Definition**: The position or role of a dish within a structured meal sequence.

**Examples**: Appetizer, Main Course, Side Dish, Dessert

**Guidelines**:
- Describes role in multi-course meal
- Appetizer = first course, Main = centerpiece, Side = accompaniment, Dessert = final
- Independent of Meal Type (appetizers can be served at lunch or dinner)

---

### Dish Type
**Definition**: The structural form or format of a prepared dish.

**Examples**: Soup, Salad, Sandwich, Pizza, Casserole, Pasta, Bowl, Stew

**Guidelines**:
- Describes what the dish IS, not when/how it's eaten
- Can overlap with Course (e.g., soup can be appetizer or main)
- Focus on recognizable formats

---

### Dietary
**Definition**: Dietary restrictions, preferences, or nutritional characteristics that limit ingredients or preparation.

**Examples**: Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, Keto, Paleo, Halal, Kosher, Nut-Free

**Hierarchical Relationships**:
- Vegan ⊂ Vegetarian (all vegan is vegetarian)
- Strict Keto ⊂ Keto
- Dairy-Free ⊂ Allergen-Free (conceptual parent)

**Guidelines**:
- Only tag if recipe FULLY meets restriction (no "mostly vegetarian")
- Multiple dietary tags allowed (e.g., "Vegan" + "Gluten-Free")
- Use most specific applicable tag

---

### Cooking Method
**Definition**: The primary cooking technique, heat application method, or kitchen appliance used to prepare the dish.

**Examples**: Baked, Grilled, Sautéed, Steamed, Slow-Cooked, Instant Pot, Air Fryer, Sous Vide

**Hierarchical Relationships**:
- Dry Heat: Baking, Grilling, Sautéing, Frying, Air Frying
- Moist Heat: Steaming, Boiling, Poaching
- Combination: Braising, Stewing

**Guidelines**:
- Use dominant method if multiple (e.g., Braised = primary, even if starts with searing)
- Appliance-specific tags encouraged (Instant Pot, Air Fryer, Slow Cooker)
- Can have 1-2 method tags if genuinely combined techniques

---

### Main Ingredient
**Definition**: The primary ingredient(s) that define the dish's identity and flavor.

**Examples**: Chicken, Beef, Salmon, Pasta, Rice, Tofu, Vegetables, Cheese

**Guidelines**:
- Typically 1-2 main ingredients maximum
- Must be central to dish (not just a garnish or minor component)
- For mixed dishes, use most prominent (e.g., Chicken Alfredo → Chicken + Pasta)

---

### Season/Holiday
**Definition**: Seasonal availability, holiday association, or time-of-year context for the dish.

**Examples**: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, Halloween

**Guidelines**:
- Season = ingredient availability (e.g., Summer for tomatoes, Fall for pumpkin)
- Holiday = traditional/cultural association (e.g., Thanksgiving for turkey)
- Multiple seasonal tags allowed (e.g., Fall + Thanksgiving)

---

### Planning
**Definition**: Meal preparation strategy, timing, or storage characteristics that affect how the recipe is used.

**Examples**: Make-Ahead, Freezer-Friendly, Meal Prep, Batch Cooking, Leftovers-Friendly, One-Pot

**Guidelines**:
- Describes HOW recipe fits into meal planning workflow
- Distinct from cooking time (use prepTime/cookTime fields for that)
- Can have multiple (e.g., "Make-Ahead" + "Freezer-Friendly")

---

### Characteristics
**Definition**: Descriptive qualities, flavor profiles, or contextual attributes that don't fit other categories.

**Examples**: Comfort Food, Kid-Friendly, Healthy, Spicy, Party, Crowd-Pleaser, Budget-Friendly, Gourmet

**Guidelines**:
- Subjective descriptors welcome
- Helps with discovery ("I want comfort food" vs specific cuisine/method)
- Limit to 1-2 characteristic tags to avoid over-tagging

---

### Other
**Definition**: Catchall for tags that don't fit established categories.

**Examples**: Custom user tags, emerging trends, niche categories

**Guidelines**:
- Temporary home for new tags before formal categorization
- Review periodically to promote popular tags to proper categories
- Avoid using if tag fits any other category

---

## 10. Key Questions Answered

### Q1: What are the essential top-level categories?

**Answer**: **11 categories** (revised from 10)

1. Cuisine
2. Meal Type
3. Course
4. Dish Type (NEW)
5. Dietary
6. Cooking Method
7. Main Ingredient
8. Season/Holiday
9. Planning (NEW)
10. Characteristics (NEW)
11. Other

**Rationale**: These cover all primary dimensions users search by: origin, timing, structure, restrictions, technique, ingredients, context, and strategy.

---

### Q2: Should "Difficulty" be a tag or a separate field?

**Answer**: **Separate database field** ✅

**Reasoning**:
1. Schema.org does NOT include difficulty as a standard property
2. Major platforms treat it as a field/filter, not a tag
3. Difficulty is intrinsic to the recipe (not a discovery keyword)
4. Database field allows precise filtering without tag duplication
5. Tags should be discovery-focused; difficulty is a constraint

**Implementation**: Use existing `difficulty` field in recipes table, remove from tags

---

### Q3: How to handle "Quick" vs "Make-Ahead" (time-based tags)?

**Answer**: **Split into two concepts**

1. **Active Cooking Time** → Use `prepTime` + `cookTime` database fields
   - Remove vague tags ("Quick", "Medium", "Long")
   - Provide computed UI filters ("Under 30 min", "30-60 min", etc.)
   - Precise, objective, better UX

2. **Planning Strategy** → New "Planning" category
   - "Make-Ahead", "Freezer-Friendly", "Meal Prep", "Batch Cooking"
   - Describes workflow, not duration
   - Complements time fields

**Rationale**: Time is continuous (45 min, 1.5 hr), not categorical. Tags should describe qualities, not measurements.

---

### Q4: Should dietary restrictions be tags or filters?

**Answer**: **Both - tags for discovery, filters for constraints**

**Use as Tags**:
- Users browse "vegan recipes" (discovery)
- SEO keywords ("vegan pasta recipe")
- Related tag suggestions

**Use as Filters**:
- "Show me ONLY gluten-free recipes" (constraint)
- Faceted search (cuisine + dietary + time filters)
- User preferences ("I'm vegetarian - hide non-veg")

**Implementation**: Keep dietary tags in ontology + add dedicated filter UI with checkboxes

---

### Q5: How deep should cuisine hierarchies go?

**Answer**: **Maximum 2 levels** (Country → Region)

**Examples**:
- ✅ Italian → Sicilian (2 levels)
- ✅ Chinese → Cantonese (2 levels)
- ❌ Italian → Southern Italian → Sicilian → Palermo Style (4 levels - too deep)

**Rationale**:
1. Users recognize regional cuisines (Sicilian, Tuscan) but not sub-regional (Palermo vs Catania)
2. UX complexity increases exponentially with depth
3. Most recipe sites stop at 1-2 levels
4. Mobile UI constraints (limited screen space)

**Exception**: Allow 3 levels for academic/research mode (opt-in), default to 2 levels

---

### Q6: What's the relationship between "Course" and "Meal Type"?

**Answer**: **Independent, orthogonal dimensions**

**Meal Type** = WHEN eaten (time of day)
- Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Brunch

**Course** = POSITION in meal sequence
- Appetizer, Main Course, Side Dish, Dessert

**Example**:
- Caesar Salad can be:
  - **Meal Type**: Lunch (eaten at midday)
  - **Course**: Appetizer (first course at dinner)
  - Both tags valid, non-overlapping

**Clarification**: We previously mixed these (e.g., "Appetizer" in Meal Type). Now separated cleanly.

## 11. Best Practices Summary

### Tag Reusability
✅ **DO**: Use semantic tags consistently across recipes (e.g., always "Italian", not "italian" or "Italy")
✅ **DO**: Map synonyms to canonical tags ("plant-based" → "vegan")
❌ **DON'T**: Create one-off custom tags (use "Other" category if needed)
❌ **DON'T**: Duplicate tags across categories (assign to ONE category)

---

### Search and Filter Optimization
✅ **DO**: Tag with user search intent in mind (how would they find this?)
✅ **DO**: Use popular tags for discoverability (check popularity scores)
✅ **DO**: Combine tags from multiple categories (cuisine + dietary + method)
❌ **DON'T**: Over-tag (more than 8 tags dilutes search signal)
❌ **DON'T**: Use obscure tags only you understand (prefer common terms)

---

### User-Friendly Tag Discovery
✅ **DO**: Show related tag suggestions (if tagged "Italian", suggest "Pasta")
✅ **DO**: Group tags by category in UI (color-coded, visually separated)
✅ **DO**: Provide autocomplete with synonym matching
❌ **DON'T**: Show all 124 tags at once (overwhelming)
❌ **DON'T**: Force users to know exact tag names (fuzzy search)

---

### SEO Considerations
✅ **DO**: Use 3-5 tags per recipe for optimal SEO
✅ **DO**: Include cuisine + dietary tags (high search volume)
✅ **DO**: Map tags to Schema.org properties (recipeCuisine, recipeCategory, keywords)
✅ **DO**: Use long-tail keywords ("vegan pasta recipe" > "recipe")
❌ **DON'T**: Keyword stuff (10+ tags hurts ranking)
❌ **DON'T**: Use tags unrelated to recipe (misleads search engines)

---

### Maintenance and Evolution
✅ **DO**: Review "Other" category tags quarterly (promote popular ones)
✅ **DO**: Add new tags based on user requests (Sous Vide, Pescatarian)
✅ **DO**: Update popularity scores based on usage analytics
✅ **DO**: Deprecate unused tags gracefully (map to synonyms)
❌ **DON'T**: Delete tags used in existing recipes (breaks backward compatibility)
❌ **DON'T**: Rename tags without migration script

---
