# Recipe Tag Taxonomy Research - Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Full Report**: `docs/research/RECIPE_TAG_TAXONOMY_RESEARCH.md`

## Key Findings

### 1. Our System is Well-Designed ‚úÖ

Our current 10-category semantic tag system aligns with industry standards:
- Matches Schema.org recipe properties
- Comparable to NYT Cooking, AllRecipes, Food Network
- Hierarchical support (Italian ‚Üí Sicilian) matches best practices
- Synonym mapping ("plant-based" ‚Üí "vegan") prevents duplicates

**Conclusion**: No major redesign needed, only refinements.

---

## 2. Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Category Refinement (4 hours)

**Add 3 New Categories**:
1. **Dish Type**: Soup, Salad, Sandwich, Pizza, Casserole, Bowl
   - Why: Separates structure from course position
   - Example: "Soup" is a dish type; "Appetizer" is a course

2. **Planning**: Make-Ahead, Freezer-Friendly, Meal Prep, Batch Cooking
   - Why: Describes workflow, not cooking time
   - Distinct from prepTime/cookTime fields

3. **Characteristics**: Comfort Food, Kid-Friendly, Healthy, Spicy, Party
   - Why: Descriptive tags that don't fit other categories
   - Helps discovery ("I want comfort food")

**Clean Up Existing**:
- Remove "Appetizer", "Dessert", "Side", "Main" from Meal Type
- Add "Appetizer", "Dessert" to Course
- Move "Make-Ahead", "Overnight" from Time to Planning

---

### Priority 2: Difficulty Should Be a Field, Not a Tag (1 day)

**Problem**: Difficulty is both a tag category AND a database field
- Redundant data
- Schema.org doesn't include difficulty as tag property
- Major platforms treat it as a filter, not a tag

**Solution**:
- Remove "Difficulty" tag category
- Use existing `difficulty` field (easy | medium | hard)
- Write migration script to convert difficulty tags to field values

**Impact**: Breaking change, requires data migration

---

### Priority 3: Remove Vague Time Tags (4 hours)

**Problem**: "Quick", "Medium", "Long" are imprecise
- "Quick" to one person is 15 min, to another is 45 min
- Overlaps with prepTime/cookTime fields

**Solution**:
- Remove time tags: "Quick", "Medium", "Long"
- Use database fields: `prepTime` + `cookTime`
- Add computed UI filters: "Under 30 min", "30-60 min", "1-2 hours", "2+ hours"
- Keep planning tags: "Make-Ahead", "Freezer-Friendly"

---

## 3. Industry Best Practices

### Optimal Tag Count: 2-5 Tags Per Recipe

**Research Finding**: SEO best practices recommend 2-5 tags
- Fewer than 2: Underspecified, poor discoverability
- More than 8: Dilutes SEO signal, overwhelming to users

**Recommended Mix** (for 5 tags):
1. Cuisine (Italian)
2. Meal Type/Course (Dinner, Main Course)
3. Dietary/Ingredient (Vegetarian, Chicken)
4. Method/Time (Baked, Quick)
5. Special (Holiday, Comfort Food)

**Action**: Reduce `maxTags` from 20 to 8, add UI hint

---

### Hierarchy Depth: Maximum 2-3 Levels

**Finding**: Most recipe sites limit hierarchies to 2 levels
- ‚úÖ Italian ‚Üí Sicilian (2 levels)
- ‚úÖ Vegetarian ‚Üí Vegan (2 levels)
- ‚ùå Italian ‚Üí Southern ‚Üí Sicilian ‚Üí Palermo (4 levels - too deep)

**Why**: Mobile UX constraints, user recognition, navigation complexity

**Our Implementation**: ‚úÖ Already at 2 levels, correct approach

---

### Course vs Meal Type Confusion (Industry-Wide)

**Clarification Needed**:
- **Meal Type** = WHEN eaten (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
- **Course** = POSITION in meal (Appetizer, Main, Side, Dessert)
- **Dish Type** = WHAT it is (Soup, Salad, Sandwich, Pizza)

**Example**:
- Caesar Salad:
  - Meal Type: Lunch (eaten at midday)
  - Course: Appetizer (first course at dinner)
  - Dish Type: Salad (structural form)

**Action**: Update category definitions, clean up overlaps

---

## 4. Missing Tags to Add

### Dietary (High Priority)
- Pescatarian (fish but no meat)
- Egg-Free (major allergen)
- Soy-Free (major allergen)
- Sesame-Free (new US allergen label law)

### Cooking Methods (Medium Priority)
- Sous Vide (popular home cooking method)
- Fermenting (growing trend: kimchi, kombucha, sourdough)

### Cuisines (On-Demand)
- Add regional cuisines as users request
- Peruvian, Lebanese, Filipino, etc.

---

## 5. Schema.org Alignment

**Schema.org Recipe Properties**:
- `recipeCuisine` ‚Üí Our "Cuisine" category ‚úÖ
- `recipeCategory` ‚Üí Our "Course" category ‚úÖ
- `suitableForDiet` ‚Üí Our "Dietary" category ‚úÖ
- `keywords` ‚Üí Our general tags ‚úÖ
- `prepTime` / `cookTime` ‚Üí Database fields ‚úÖ
- ‚ùå No `difficulty` property (validates our recommendation to use field, not tag)

**Conclusion**: Our tag system maps cleanly to SEO standards

---

## 6. FoodOn Ontology (Research Use Only)

**What it is**: Formal food ontology with 9,600+ food categories
**Structure**: Directed Acyclic Graph (items can have multiple parents)
**Use Case**: Food traceability, supply chain, nutrition research

**Takeaway**: Too complex for user-facing recipe apps
- Our lightweight semantic tag approach is appropriate
- Formal ontologies are academic, not consumer-friendly

---
