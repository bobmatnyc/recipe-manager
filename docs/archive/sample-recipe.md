## Recipe Information

## Ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated
- 50g Parmesan cheese, grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.
2. While pasta cooks, fry pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, Pecorino Romano, Parmesan, and a generous amount of black pepper.
4. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining the spaghetti.
5. Add drained hot pasta to the skillet with pancetta and remove from heat.
