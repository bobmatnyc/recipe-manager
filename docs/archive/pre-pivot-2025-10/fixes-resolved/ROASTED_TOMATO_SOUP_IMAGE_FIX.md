# Roasted Tomato Soup - Image Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Recipe**: Roasted Tomato Soup
**Recipe ID**: `f5562d94-1016-473c-9239-5b4ea847f03a`
**Recipe URL**: http://localhost:3002/recipes/roasted-tomato-soup

## Problem

The Roasted Tomato Soup recipe had 2 broken external image URLs:
1. `https://example.com/roasted-tomato-soup-1.jpg`
2. `https://example.com/roasted-tomato-soup-2.jpg`

These images were returning 404 errors and not displaying on the recipe page.

---

## Solution

Created an automated script to:
1. Find the recipe by slug (`roasted-tomato-soup`)
2. Generate a new professional food photography image using OpenAI DALL-E 3
3. Upload the generated image to Vercel Blob storage
4. Update the recipe's images array with the new image URL
5. Remove all broken images

---

## Implementation Details

### Script Created
**File**: `scripts/fix-roasted-tomato-soup-images.ts`

**Key Steps**:
1. **Database Query**: Used Drizzle ORM to find recipe by slug
2. **AI Image Generation**: Used DALL-E 3 with custom prompt
3. **Image Upload**: Uploaded to Vercel Blob storage for permanent hosting
4. **Database Update**: Updated recipe with new image array

### DALL-E 3 Prompt Used
```
Professional food photography of a bowl of roasted tomato soup.
The soup is a vibrant red-orange color with a smooth, velvety texture.
It's garnished with a drizzle of cream, fresh basil leaves, and croutons.
The bowl is white ceramic, placed on a rustic wooden table with soft natural lighting.
High-quality, appetizing, restaurant-quality presentation.
Shot from a slight overhead angle with shallow depth of field.
```

## Verification

**Database Query Confirmed**:
```typescript
Recipe ID: f5562d94-1016-473c-9239-5b4ea847f03a
Name: Roasted Tomato Soup
Slug: roasted-tomato-soup
Updated: 2025-10-19 12:19:15 GMT-0400
Images: [
  "https://ljqhvy0frzhuigv1.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/recipe-images/roasted-tomato-soup-1760890754529.png"
]
```

**Test URL**: http://localhost:3002/recipes/roasted-tomato-soup

## Script Usage

To run the fix script:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/fix-roasted-tomato-soup-images.ts
```

**Prerequisites**:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in `.env.local`
- OpenAI package installed (`^5.20.3`)

---

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies Used
- **OpenAI SDK**: v5.20.3 for DALL-E 3 API
- **@vercel/blob**: For permanent image storage
- **Drizzle ORM**: For database operations
- **tsx**: For TypeScript script execution

### Database Schema
Updated field:
- `recipes.images` (text/JSON array)
- `recipes.updated_at` (timestamp)

### Error Handling
- Script validates recipe exists before proceeding
- Catches and logs errors during image generation
- Validates image URL before upload
- Transaction-safe database update

---

## Reusability

This script can be adapted for other recipes with broken images:
1. Change the slug in the `where` clause
2. Adjust the DALL-E prompt to match the recipe
3. Run the script

**Future Enhancement**: Create a batch script to fix all recipes with broken images at once.

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **Recipe Found**: Located by slug successfully
✅ **Image Generated**: DALL-E 3 created high-quality image
✅ **Image Uploaded**: Successfully uploaded to Vercel Blob
✅ **Database Updated**: Recipe images array updated
✅ **Broken Images Removed**: Old placeholder URLs removed
✅ **Verification Passed**: New image displays on recipe page

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Batch Processing**: Create script to find and fix all recipes with broken images
2. **Image Validation**: Add automated checks for 404 images
3. **Backup Strategy**: Keep old images in separate field before replacement
4. **Quality Control**: Add admin UI to review AI-generated images before replacement

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact**: Recipe now displays properly with professional AI-generated image
