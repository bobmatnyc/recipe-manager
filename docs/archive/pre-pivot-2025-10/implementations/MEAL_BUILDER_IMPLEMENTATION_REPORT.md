✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with 44x44px touch targets
✅ **Production Build**: Clean build with no TypeScript errors

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Server Actions (Enhanced)

**File**: `/src/app/actions/meals.ts`

#### New Server Actions

##### `getPublicMeals(params?: unknown)`
- **Purpose**: Fetch all publicly shared meals for community discovery
- **Access**: Public (no authentication required)
- **Features**:
  - Filters by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.)
  - Returns top 50 most recent public meals
  - Ordered by creation date (newest first)
  - Zod validation for query parameters

```typescript
// Example usage
const result = await getPublicMeals({ mealType: 'dinner' });
// Returns: { success: true, data: Meal[] }
```

##### `getRecipeRecommendations(mainRecipeId: string)`
- **Purpose**: AI-powered recipe recommendations based on main dish analysis
- **Access**: Public (works for all users)
- **AI Analysis**:
  - Cuisine type (Italian, Mexican, Asian, etc.)
  - Cooking method (grilled, baked, fried, etc.)
  - Flavor profile (spicy, savory, light, rich, etc.)
  - Main ingredient (chicken, beef, fish, vegetarian, etc.)
- **Returns**:
  - 3-5 recommended sides
  - 2-3 recommended appetizers
  - 2-3 recommended desserts
  - Analysis object with dish characteristics

```typescript
// Example usage
const result = await getRecipeRecommendations('recipe-uuid');
// Returns: {
//   success: true,
//   data: {
//     appetizers: Recipe[],
//     sides: Recipe[],
//     desserts: Recipe[],
//     analysis: { cuisine, cookingMethod, flavorProfile, mainIngredient }
//   }
// }
```

**Total Lines Added**: 85 lines

### 2. AI Meal Recommendations Module

**File**: `/src/lib/ai/meal-recommendations.ts` (NEW)

#### Core Functionality

##### `generateMealRecommendations(mainRecipe: Recipe)`
Main entry point for AI recommendations. Orchestrates:
1. AI analysis of main dish
2. Parallel database searches for complementary recipes
3. Results filtering and ranking

##### `analyzeMainDish(mainRecipe: Recipe)`
Uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via OpenRouter) to analyze:
- **Input**: Recipe name, description, cuisine, tags, ingredients
- **Output**: JSON with cuisine, cooking method, flavor profile, main ingredient
- **Fallback**: Uses recipe metadata if AI fails
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (deterministic results)
- **Response Format**: JSON object mode for structured output

##### `searchRecipesByCategory(category, analysis, excludeRecipeId)`
Intelligent recipe search by category:
- **Appetizers**: cuisine-specific starters (bruschetta, guacamole, dumplings, etc.)
- **Sides**: complementary dishes (risotto, coleslaw, stir-fry vegetables, etc.)
- **Desserts**: matching sweets (tiramisu, churros, mochi, etc.)

#### Search Strategy

```typescript
// Priority ranking:
// 1. Cuisine match (e.g., Italian main → Italian sides)
// 2. Flavor compatibility (e.g., Rich main → Light dessert)
// 3. Cooking method complement (e.g., Grilled main → Roasted sides)
// 4. Public/system recipe quality (system_rating DESC)
```

#### Cuisine-Specific Term Matching

**Italian Main Dish** → Suggests:
- Appetizers: bruschetta, antipasto, caprese
- Sides: risotto, polenta, pasta, vegetables
- Desserts: tiramisu, panna cotta, gelato, cannoli

**Mexican Main Dish** → Suggests:
- Appetizers: guacamole, salsa, quesadilla, nachos
- Sides: rice, beans, corn, elote
- Desserts: flan, churro, tres leches

**Asian Main Dish** → Suggests:
- Appetizers: spring roll, dumpling, edamame, tempura
- Sides: rice, noodle, stir-fry, bok choy
- Desserts: mochi, mango sticky rice, sesame desserts

**Total Lines**: 263 lines

## AI Recommendation Algorithm

### Step 1: Main Dish Analysis

```typescript
Input: Recipe object
  ↓
AI Analysis (Gemini 2.0 Flash):
  - Parse recipe name, description, ingredients
  - Extract cuisine type
  - Identify cooking method
  - Determine flavor profile
  - Identify main ingredient
  ↓
Output: {
  cuisine: "Italian",
  cookingMethod: "grilled",
  flavorProfile: "savory",
  mainIngredient: "chicken"
}
```

### Step 2: Search Term Generation

```typescript
Based on cuisine + category:
  Italian + Appetizer → ["appetizer", "bruschetta", "antipasto", "caprese"]
  Italian + Side → ["side", "risotto", "polenta", "pasta", "vegetables"]
  Italian + Dessert → ["dessert", "tiramisu", "panna cotta", "gelato"]
```

### Step 3: Database Search

```sql
SELECT * FROM recipes
WHERE (
  cuisine ILIKE '%Italian%'
  OR tags::text ILIKE ANY(search_terms)
  OR name::text ILIKE ANY(search_terms)
  OR description::text ILIKE ANY(search_terms)
)
AND id != main_recipe_id
AND (is_public = true OR is_system_recipe = true)
ORDER BY system_rating DESC, created_at DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Step 4: Results Ranking

1. **Cuisine match**: Same cuisine as main dish
2. **System rating**: Higher rated recipes first
3. **Recency**: Newer recipes preferred
4. **Diversity**: Different recipes across categories

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Touch Targets
- All buttons: **44x44px minimum** (iOS/Android standard)
- Recipe cards: Optimized for touch
- Form inputs: Large, accessible

### Layouts
- **Mobile** (< 768px): 1 column for recipe cards
- **Tablet** (768-1024px): 2 columns for recipe cards
- **Desktop** (> 1024px): 3 columns for recipe cards

### Mobile-First Design
```css
/* MealsList component */
grid-cols-1           /* Mobile: 1 column */
md:grid-cols-2        /* Tablet: 2 columns */
lg:grid-cols-3        /* Desktop: 3 columns */
```

---

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Queries
- Indexed columns: `is_public`, `meal_type`, `cuisine`
- Limited results: Top 50 public meals
- Efficient joins: mealRecipes → recipes

### 2. AI Caching
- AI analysis results could be cached by recipe ID
- Future enhancement: Redis cache for recommendations

### 3. Client-Side Optimization
- Debounced AI suggestions (800ms)
- Lazy loading for recipe images
- Memoized components (React.memo)

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication
- Guest meals: Read-only, localStorage only
- User meals: Scoped to userId (Clerk)
- Public meals: Read-only for all users

### 2. Data Validation
- All inputs validated with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention via Drizzle ORM
- Type-safe database queries

### 3. API Security
- Server actions: CSRF protection via Next.js
- OpenRouter API key: Server-side only (never exposed)
- User data: Isolated by userId
