## Site Feedback

### Rescue Ingredients Page

#### Visual/Design Elements
- **Replace alert icon** with recycling symbol or rescue imagery ("pulling somebody out of the water")
- **Remove redundant checkmarks** if all items are checked
- **FIFO in circle**: Questioned why it's circular (consider alternative presentation)

#### FIFO Section Content
**Current issue:** Says "oldest ingredients should be used first"

**Joanie's feedback:**
- This is obvious and not the right focus
- Should emphasize: "What's about to go off?" not just "what's old"
- Key message: "Are you about to throw it away? You can use it today"
- Focus on: Check your fridge regularly for what's expiring
- **Critical distinction:** Old ≠ ready to throw out. You might be able to use it today even if old.

**Better language:** 
- "Aging, wilting, about to expire"
- "Check your fridge regularly"

**Note on expiration dates:**
- Expiration dates are often misleading
- Especially yogurt - unless it has mold, it's fine

#### Wilting Greens Section

**Pro tip to add:**
- **Dress salads at the table** so leftovers can be stored as undressed greens
- Dressed greens degrade faster (except kale)
- Kale can be dressed and turned into relish

**Content notes:**
- Don't list every type of kale ("there's like a hundred others")
- Current list is a good start
- **Collard greens:** Never eat fresh, always cook them

**Storage indicators good:**
- Slimy, moldy, completely brown - all correct
- Soft = okay for cooking

#### Aging Vegetables

**Philosophy note:**
- Soft carrots: "They're not trash, they're dinner"
- Joanie loved this framing

**Quick pickle vs. pickle distinction:**
**Critical correction needed:**
- Currently says "pickle or quick pickle" - these are different things
- **Remove "pickle" option** - only show "quick pickle"
- **Reason:** Real pickling requires VERY fresh vegetables
- "I would never pickle an old vegetable ever"
- Quick pickling is fine for aging vegetables
- Don't specify water amount or vinegar type - varies by preference

**Carrot storage:**
**Current content issue:** Describes storing in water upright (like flowers)

**Joanie's method:**
- Never buy baby carrots (they're carved mature carrots, dry out fast, disgusting)
- Buy regular carrots
- Remove tops immediately ("gotta take off the tops")
  - If left on in water, they think they're still growing
  - Get them twisted off at farmer's market
- **Prep before storing:** Wash, peel first
- Cut to desired shape if you know how you'll use them
  - Sticks if for snacking/crudité
  - Rounds if for cooking
  - Whole/halved if undecided
- Store in water IN THE FRIDGE (not upright like flowers)
- Submerge horizontally in Tupperware
- Ready to use immediately

**Mise en place philosophy:**
- Easier to figure out what to use if prep is already done
- If buying peppers you'll use in next few days, cut them up immediately
- Store in tight Ziploc bag
- Same for celery, broccoli, cauliflower

**Squash correction needed:**
**Current issue:** Groups all squashes together

**Joanie's correction:**
- **Summer squash** (soft squash): Zucchini, refrigerate
- **Winter squash** (hard squash): Pumpkin, acorn, butternut, spaghetti - store with potatoes/onions (NOT refrigerated)
- **Delicata:** Special case - looks hard but treat like summer squash
  - "Most delicious of all squashes"
  - Never ages - cook immediately
  - "Straddles the line between hard and summer squash"
  - Joanie's note: "If those go bad, you're not allowed to buy delicata squash for 12 more months" (criminal waste)

**Other vegetables:**
- Celery: Store like carrots (in water, can combine in crudité prep)
- Broccoli: Can crisp in water OR pre-portion in Ziploc like peppers
- Cauliflower: Same as broccoli
- Eggplant: Gets wrinkly when old → make baba ganoush

#### Leftover Proteins

**Current content good:**
- Fried rice and grain bowls ✓
- Tacos and wraps ✓
- Soups and stews ✓

**Additional suggestions:**
- **Hot sandwiches:** Sloppy joe style or hot roast beef/turkey with gravy/cranberry
- **Key principle:** Warming old protein is essential
- Can do a lot with old hamburgers
- Example: Korean ground beef (gochujang, fresh ginger, garlic, add to rice bowls with kimchi)

#### Herbs Section

**Storage method:**
- Treat like fresh flowers in florist refrigerator
- Cut stems at sharp angle
- Stand in water in fridge
- Cover with plastic bag from supermarket, secure with rubber band
- Creates little bouquet
- **Important:** Don't put on shelf with drinks (will tip over)

**"Buy in Bulk" contradiction:**
**Issue:** Page says both "buy what you need" and "buy in bulk"

**Joanie's correction:**
- Remove contradictory advice
- "Let them buy it the way they want to buy it"
- Most herbs NOT sold in huge bunches anymore (plastic boxes, $5)
- CAN buy in bulk IF you're processing (freezing, drying)
- Don't buy fresh in bulk unless using in bulk
- Exception: If you love processing/drying herbs

**Drying herbs:**
- Can dry all of these yourself
- Even with garden abundance: use some fresh, dry the excess
- Adds to dried herb jar in cupboard
- Over-buying fresh with intention to dry is fine

**Remove:** Specific drying instructions about basil, oregano, dill
- "You can dry your own self. You don't need to buy dry"
- All herbs listed can be dried

## Recipes

### Baba Ganoush

**When to make:** When eggplants get wrinkly/old

**Cooking method:**
1. Can roast on charcoal grill (outside) OR in oven
2. Roast whole eggplants - poke holes first so they don't explode
3. Want them to collapse on themselves with softness
4. Oven: ~400°F on sheet pan
5. Let collapse, pull out, let cool until handleable
6. Peel - flesh is gray, not attractive

**Ingredients:**
- Roasted eggplant flesh
- Tahini
- Lemon juice
- Salt
- Garlic (roasted with eggplant preferred)
- **Liquid smoke** (if not using charcoal - key ingredient)

**Garlic notes:**
- Roast garlic at same time as eggplant (preferred)
- If forget: use fresh garlic, but less of it
- Roasted garlic adds sweetness appropriate for baba ganoush
- See "Raw Garlic Pro Tip" below

**Smoke flavor:**
- If grilled on charcoal/fire: smoke is in it naturally
- If oven-roasted: add liquid smoke
- Without charcoal or liquid smoke, lacks characteristic flavor

### Guacamole

**Joanie's perfect proportions:**

**Base:**
- 2 perfect avocados

**Onion:**
- Real ordinary but VERY FRESH yellow onion (not white Vidalia)
- Want oniony flavor, not sweet onion
- Dice pretty fine (not super fine mush, not huge chunks)
- **Critical step:** Rinse diced onion under water to remove skunky onion juice
- Volume: One handful

**Cilantro:**
- Equal volume to onion (not by weight)
- If onion fills palm to knuckles, match that volume of cilantro
- Use unchopped/squished together cilantro to measure
- Then chop it up
- "Seems like too much cilantro, but it's not. It's good."

**Heat:**
- Usually jalapeño, seeded
- **Critical:** Every jalapeño has different heat - inconsistent
- Start with one, taste as you go
- If insipid (tastes like terrible green pepper): introduce seeds or use two
- If spicy: keep seeded
- Red jalapeños run hotter than green
- "Not a stickler" - red flecks look nice too

**Other:**
- Lime
- Salt

**What's NOT in it:**
- **NO garlic** (emphasized)
- **NO tomato** ("never")
  - "Want tomato with your Mexican food, make a salsa. Make a pico de gallo. That doesn't belong in guacamole."

### Raw Garlic Pro Tip (General Cooking)

**The problem with raw garlic:**
- Lingers on breath
- Can disagree with digestive system
- Sometimes you want garlic flavor without the heat

**Solution: Acid infusion method**
1. Chop garlic in your acid (usually lemon, lime, or vinegar)
2. Can use stick blender/hand wand
3. Let sit for a bit
4. Strain out garlic
5. Use garlic-infused acid in recipe

**Result:**
- Garlic flavor without raw garlic heat
- No lingering breath issues
- No digestive problems
- Works in any dish using acid + fresh garlic

**Roasted garlic alternative:**
- Sweeter than raw
- Good for some dishes (like baba ganoush)
- Not always wanted (sweetness changes dish character)

### Storage & Preservation Tips

#### Freezing Strategies

**Wilting fruit:**
- Freeze for smoothies
- **Substandard melons:** Cut into melon, not good, chop and freeze
- "Every smoothie I've ever made that has melon in it is slightly better"
- Adds water content (smoothies can be too thick with all yogurt/fruit)

**Airtight freezing technique:**
- **For containers not filled to top:**
  1. Bang container on counter to remove air bubbles
  2. Tear off cling film
  3. Place cling film to TOUCH the food surface
  4. Then put lid on
  5. Air gap now between plastic wrap and lid (less air = less freezer burn)

**Labels:**
- Always label and date

#### Refrigerator Storage

**Same double-airtight method:**
- Primarily for preventing oxidation (color change)
- Not about "refrigerator burn" like freezer burn
- **Guacamole tip:** Rub plastic wrap with tail end of lime before pressing onto guacamole
  - Acidifies the plastic
  - Helps keep guacamole green

## Spices & Pantry

### Essential Dried Herbs

**Must-haves:**
- Basil
- Oregano
- Tarragon
- **Sage:** "Overrated" - too aromatic, takes over
  - Good for poultry
  - Won't feature every day

### Essential Spices

**Cumin - "Life changing"**
- **Critical:** Do NOT buy ground cumin
- Buy cumin seed
- Grind as needed
- **Tools:** Mortar & pestle is fine (Joanie's preference)
  - Alternative: Cheap blade coffee grinder dedicated to spices
  - NOT a burr coffee grinder
  - Joanie doesn't make enough at once to need electric grinder

**Other essentials:**
- Star anise
- Nutmeg
- Szechuan peppercorn

### Regional Spice Collections

**Mediterranean (Ottolenghi reference):**
- Sumac
- See Yotam Ottolenghi's Mediterranean larder list

**Asian (Kenji reference):**
- See Kenji López-Alt's Asian larder staples list

### Refrigerated Essentials

**Asian condiments:**
- Gochujang
- Miso (red and white varieties)
- Sambal
- Black bean chili sauce
- Szechuan chili oil (personal taste)

## Philosophy & Sustainability

### Chefs Section Feedback

**Issue raised:** "Why does it say sustainability chefs? Lidia Bastianich is not about sustainability."

**Implication:** 
- Need to review all chef categorizations
- Ensure alignment with stated section themes
- May need to recategorize or create different chef groupings

### General Tone

Throughout the conversation, Joanie's philosophy emerges:
- Practical, waste-reducing approach
- "They're not trash, they're dinner"
- Focus on using what you have rather than buying new
- Knowledge of proper storage extends ingredient life
- Prep work (mise en place) makes cooking from fridge easier
- Anti-waste but not precious about perfection
