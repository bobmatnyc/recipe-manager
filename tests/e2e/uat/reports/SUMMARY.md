## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Run manual browser test** to verify typing works
2. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
3. **Monitor network tab** for API calls during search

### Short-term
1. Enable Safari automation settings
2. Install Playwright browsers
3. Fix Playwright auth setup timeout

### Long-term
1. Add dedicated FridgeInput E2E tests
2. Implement browser console monitoring
3. Add accessibility attributes (aria-label, id, name)
4. Create no-auth test variants for public pages

## 🏆 Bottom Line

### The Good News ✅
- **Component is present and rendered**
- **HTML structure is correct**
- **Input field exists with proper attributes**
- **No server errors**
- **Page loads successfully**

### The Reality Check ⚠️
- **Cannot verify typing without browser runtime**
- **Automation tools blocked by permissions/setup**
- **Need manual testing OR fix automation blockers**

### Verdict
**The FridgeInput component appears to be correctly implemented.** HTML analysis shows proper structure, but **runtime verification is needed** to confirm typing works and no JavaScript errors occur.

**Recommended Action:** Run 5-minute manual browser test to verify.
